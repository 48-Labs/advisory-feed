    Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Cisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability 
    Cisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability 

The Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability and the Cisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process to become unresponsive or crash. When this occurs, the Cisco IPS will stop inspecting traffic.



The Cisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the MainApp process to become unresponsive and prevent it from executing several tasks including alert
notification, event store management, and sensor authentication. The
Cisco IPS web server will also be unavailable while the MainApp process is unresponsive, and other processes such as the Analysis Engine process may not work properly.

 


Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate some of the vulnerabilities are available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140219-ips["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140219-ips"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability



The following products are affected by the Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability:


    Cisco ASA 5500-X Series IPS Security Services Processor (IPS SSP) software and hardware modules
    Cisco ASA 5500 Series Advanced Inspection and Prevention Security Services Module (AIP SSM) 
    Cisco IPS 4200 Series Sensors
    Cisco IPS 4300 Series Sensors
    
    Cisco IPS 4500 Series Sensors

This vulnerability does not affect Cisco IPS Software releases prior to 7.1(4)E4. 



This vulnerability affects only Cisco IPS Software configured with a signature with the produce-verbose-alert action enabled or systems on which an event action override (EAO) is configured to add this action.



To determine whether the produce-verbose-alert option is used in any of the active signatures or in an EAO configuration use the show configuration command.



The following example shows signature ID 1475/0 modified to enable the produce-verbose-alert option:

Customers who use Cisco Intrusion Prevention System Device Manager (IDM)
to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is
displayed in the login window or top left corner of the Cisco IDM
window.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco IPS is a family of network security devices that provide
network-based threat prevention services. Cisco IPS Software includes
several applications that are used by the system to run different tasks.
In particular, the MainApp process is responsible for multiple
critical tasks, including reading the configuration, starting and
stopping applications, and authentication service, while the Analysis Engine process is responsible for the analysis and inspection of traffic passing through the sensor.



Additional information about the MainApp and Analysis Engine processes is in the "System Architecture" section of the product configuration guide:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/ips/7.1/configuration/guide/idm/idm_system_architecture.html#wp1126061["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/ips/7.1/configuration/guide/idm/idm_system_architecture.html#wp1126061"]



Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the produce-verbose-alert code of Cisco Intrusion
Prevention System (IPS) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process to become unresponsive.



The
vulnerability is due to improper handling of fragmented packets by the
Analysis Engine process when the produce-verbose-alert action is enabled. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented packets
through the affected system. To trigger the vulnerability, the
attacker could cause a signature with the produce-verbose-alert action to
fire, or trigger an event for which produce-verbose-alert has been configured as an event action override. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process
to become unresponsive. This will cause the affected system to stop inspecting
traffic.



The vulnerability can be triggered by IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) fragmented packets
passing through the affected system. Traffic directed to the management
IP address of the Cisco IPS will not trigger this
vulnerability.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCui91266["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui91266"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-0718.





Cisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the implementation of the control-plane access list
of the Cisco IPS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause the MainApp process to become unresponsive.



The
vulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle malformed TCP packets sent to the
management IP address of the affected system. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP packets to TCP port 7000 of the IP address of the management interface.
An exploit could allow the attacker to make the MainApp process
unresponsive. This creates a denial of service (DoS) condition because
the Cisco IPS sensor is not able to execute several critical tasks
including alert notification, event store management, and sensor
authentication. The Cisco IPS web server will also be unavailable while
the MainApp process is unresponsive. Additionally, due to this general
system failure, other processes such as the Analysis Engine may not work
properly.



The vulnerability can be triggered only by TCP traffic directed to
TCP port 7000 of the IP address of the management interface. Traffic passing through the sensing interfaces
will not trigger this vulnerability. If the Cisco IPS is configured in
promiscuous mode, mitigation actions that require MainApp processing such as shun or rate-limit
may be unavailable. If the Cisco IPS is configured in inline mode, the
sensor may not correctly perform inspection and mitigation actions
because the Analysis Engine process may not work properly.



This vulnerability affects only Cisco IPS Software running on hardware and software module for Cisco ASA 5500 Series and Cisco ASA 5500-X Series.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCui67394["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui67394"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0719.



Cisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Cisco IPS code that handles jumbo frames  could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process
to become unresponsive.



The vulnerability is due to improper
handling of jumbo frames sent a high rate. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending jumbo frames through the sensing interface
of the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process
to become unresponsive. This will cause the affected system to stop inspecting
traffic.



The vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 based jumbo frames
passing through the affected system. Traffic directed to the management
IP address of the Cisco IPS will not trigger this
vulnerability.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh94944["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh94944"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0720.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">To work around the Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability administrator can disable the produce-verbose-alert action.



Use show configuration command to determine which signature has the produce-verbose-alert option enabled or wheter the produce-verbose-alert option is enabled as EAO.



If the produce-verbose-alert has been configured at the signature level, the value can be modified by entering the signature configuration prompt and modifying the event action for each signature that needs modification to use produce-alert instead of the produce-verbose-alert action. The following example shows the procedure to change the event action from produce-verbose-alert to produce-alert for signature 1475/0:




sensor(config)# service signature-definition sig0
sensor(config-sig)# signatures 1475 0 
sensor(config-sig-sig)# engine string-tcp 
sensor(config-sig-sig-str)# event-action produce-alert
sensor(config-sig-sig-str)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig)# exit
sensor(config-sig)# exit
Apply Changes?[yes]: yes
sensor(config)#



Alternatively, an administrator can use the Cisco Intrusion Prevention System Device Manager (IDM) to
connect to the Cisco IPS and navigate to Configuration &gt; Policies
&gt; Signature Definitions &gt;  -Sig-Definition-Name- &gt; Active
Signatures and filter by using Filter: Action Produce Verbose Alert in order to verify any active signatures with the produce-verbose-alert option enabled.



For each of the signatures, right-click and choose Edit Action. From the panel, uncheck the Produce Verbose Alert check box, click the OK and apply the changes.



If the produce-verbose-alert action is enabled as EAO, this can be disable by modifying the settings for the event action rules policy.



The following example shows how to disable the override with produce-verbose-alert configured in the rules0 event action rules policy:




sensor(config)# service event-action-rules rules0
sensor(config-eve)# no overrides produce-verbose-alert 
sensor(config-eve)# exit
Apply Changes?[yes]: yes
sensor(config)# 





There is no workaround for the Cisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability , however restricting the number of allowed hosts may reduce the exposure of this vulnerability.



To restrict the number of allowed hosts, the administrator should use the access-list command. The no access-list command should be used to remove any hosts or networks from the list.

The following example shows the sequence of commands to remove
access to the full 192.168.1.0/24 network and allow access only to the
host with IP address 192.168.1.1:

    Use the show settings command in
    network-setting configuration mode to see the current allowed hosts or
    networks. The following example shows that the Cisco IDSM-2 is
    configured to allow all the hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network:


sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings
   network-settings
   -----------------------------------------------
      [...]
      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)
      -----------------------------------------------
         network-address: 192.168.1.0/24
         -----------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------
      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds 
      login-banner-text: 
      [...]


    Use the access-list command in network-setting
    configuration mode to add the 192.168.1.1 hosts.

Note: make sure that if this
is the only allowed host, it is also the one from which you are
executing the configuration commands to avoid losing connectivity to the Cisco
IDSM-2 Module.

sensor(config-hos-net)#access-list 192.168.1.1/32


    Use the no access-list command in network-setting configuration mode to remove the 192.168.1.0/32 network for the allowed hosts list:


sensor(config-hos-net)#no access-list 192.168.1.0/24


    Use the show settings command in network-setting configuration mode to check that the list of allowed hosts is correct:


sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings
   network-settings
   -----------------------------------------------
      [...]
      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)
      -----------------------------------------------
         network-address: 192.168.1.1/32
         -----------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------
      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds 
      login-banner-text: 
      [...]


    Exit and apply the configuration:


sensor(config-hos-net)# exit
sensor(config-hos)# exit
Apply Changes:?[yes]: 


There is no workaround for the Cisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability.

        <Description>To work around the Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability administrator can disable the produce-verbose-alert action.



Use show configuration command to determine which signature has the produce-verbose-alert option enabled or wheter the produce-verbose-alert option is enabled as EAO.



If the produce-verbose-alert has been configured at the signature level, the value can be modified by entering the signature configuration prompt and modifying the event action for each signature that needs modification to use produce-alert instead of the produce-verbose-alert action. The following example shows the procedure to change the event action from produce-verbose-alert to produce-alert for signature 1475/0:




sensor(config)# service signature-definition sig0
sensor(config-sig)# signatures 1475 0 
sensor(config-sig-sig)# engine string-tcp 
sensor(config-sig-sig-str)# event-action produce-alert
sensor(config-sig-sig-str)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig)# exit
sensor(config-sig)# exit
Apply Changes?[yes]: yes
sensor(config)#



Alternatively, an administrator can use the Cisco Intrusion Prevention System Device Manager (IDM) to
connect to the Cisco IPS and navigate to Configuration &gt; Policies
&gt; Signature Definitions &gt;  -Sig-Definition-Name- &gt; Active
Signatures and filter by using Filter: Action Produce Verbose Alert in order to verify any active signatures with the produce-verbose-alert option enabled.



For each of the signatures, right-click and choose Edit Action. From the panel, uncheck the Produce Verbose Alert check box, click the OK and apply the changes.



If the produce-verbose-alert action is enabled as EAO, this can be disable by modifying the settings for the event action rules policy.



The following example shows how to disable the override with produce-verbose-alert configured in the rules0 event action rules policy:




sensor(config)# service event-action-rules rules0
sensor(config-eve)# no overrides produce-verbose-alert 
sensor(config-eve)# exit
Apply Changes?[yes]: yes
sensor(config)# 





There is no workaround for the Cisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability , however restricting the number of allowed hosts may reduce the exposure of this vulnerability.



To restrict the number of allowed hosts, the administrator should use the access-list command. The no access-list command should be used to remove any hosts or networks from the list.

The following example shows the sequence of commands to remove
access to the full 192.168.1.0/24 network and allow access only to the
host with IP address 192.168.1.1:

    Use the show settings command in
    network-setting configuration mode to see the current allowed hosts or
    networks. The following example shows that the Cisco IDSM-2 is
    configured to allow all the hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network:


sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings
   network-settings
   -----------------------------------------------
      [...]
      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)
      -----------------------------------------------
         network-address: 192.168.1.0/24
         -----------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------
      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds 
      login-banner-text: 
      [...]


    Use the access-list command in network-setting
    configuration mode to add the 192.168.1.1 hosts.

Note: make sure that if this
is the only allowed host, it is also the one from which you are
executing the configuration commands to avoid losing connectivity to the Cisco
IDSM-2 Module.

sensor(config-hos-net)#access-list 192.168.1.1/32


    Use the no access-list command in network-setting configuration mode to remove the 192.168.1.0/32 network for the allowed hosts list:


sensor(config-hos-net)#no access-list 192.168.1.0/24


    Use the show settings command in network-setting configuration mode to check that the list of allowed hosts is correct:


sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings
   network-settings
   -----------------------------------------------
      [...]
      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)
      -----------------------------------------------
         network-address: 192.168.1.1/32
         -----------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------
      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds 
      login-banner-text: 
      [...]


    Exit and apply the configuration:


sensor(config-hos-net)# exit
sensor(config-hos)# exit
Apply Changes:?[yes]: 


There is no workaround for the Cisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability.
