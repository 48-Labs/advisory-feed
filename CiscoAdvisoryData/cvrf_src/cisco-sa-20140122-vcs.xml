    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco
TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) contains a vulnerability that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger the failure of several critical processes which may cause active call to be dropped and prevent users from making new calls until the affected system is reloaded.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available. This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140122-vcs["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140122-vcs"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco TelePresence VCS Control, Cisco TelePresence VCS Expressway, and Cisco TelePresence VCS Starter Pack Expressway running Cisco TelePresence VCS Software prior to X8.1.

Cisco TelePresence VCS hardware and virtual appliances are both affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco TelePresence VCS
extends the benefits of face-to-face video collaboration across networks
and organizations by supporting any-to-any video and telepresence
communications.



A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) module of Cisco
TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger the failure of several critical processes, which may cause the termination of active calls. New calls will also not be established until the affected system is restored.



The vulnerability is due to
improper handling of crafted Session Description Protocol (SDP) messages.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SDP message to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to
trigger the failure of several critical processes, which may
cause the affected system to not function properly;
active calls will be terminated and new calls will not be possible
until the affected system is restored. A reload is needed to restore
correct functionality.



This vulnerability can be triggered by SDP messages sent via UDP or TCP. Deployment using Transport Layer Security (TLS) will also be affected.

The default port for UDP and TCP deployments is UDP port 5060 and TCP port 5060. The default port for TLS deployment is TCP port 5061.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue97632["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue97632"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-0662.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.



Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this Advisory: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=32409

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. 

This vulnerability is resolved in Cisco TelePresence VCS Software X8.1 and later.</cvrf:Note>
