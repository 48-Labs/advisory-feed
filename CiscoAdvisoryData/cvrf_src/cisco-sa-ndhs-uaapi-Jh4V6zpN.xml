    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2024-20438: Cisco NDFC Unauthorized REST API Endpoints Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the REST API endpoints of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to read or write files on an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because of missing authorization controls on some REST API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited network-admin functions such as reading device configuration information, uploading files, and modifying uploaded files.

Note: This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

CVE ID: CVE-2024-20438
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.3
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

CVE-2024-20441: Cisco NDFC Unauthorized REST API Endpoint Vulnerability

A vulnerability in a specific REST API endpoint of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to learn sensitive information on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization controls on the affected REST API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to the affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download config only or full backup files and learn sensitive configuration information. This vulnerability only affects a specific REST API endpoint and does not affect the web-based management interface.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID: CSCwk04220 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk04220"]
CVE ID: CVE-2024-20441

CVE-2024-20442: Cisco Nexus Dashboard Unauthorized REST API Endpoints Vulnerability


A vulnerability in the REST API endpoints of Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to perform limited Administrator actions on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization controls on some REST API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited Administrator functions such as viewing portions of the web UI, generating config only or full backup files, and deleting tech support files. This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface.

CVE-2024-20477: Cisco NDFC Unauthorized REST API Endpoint Vulnerability

A vulnerability in a specific REST API endpoint of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to upload or delete files on an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because of missing authorization controls on the affected REST API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to the affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files into a specific container or delete files from a specific folder within that container.
