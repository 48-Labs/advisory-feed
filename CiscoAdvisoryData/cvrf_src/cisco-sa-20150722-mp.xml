    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The password change functionality in the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing application could allow an unauthenticated remote, attacker to change the passwords of arbitrary users. The vulnerability is due to the following:


    Users are not required to enter the previous password during a password change request. 
    HTTP session functionality does not validate the session ID in the HTTP request for the password change request.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a crafted HTTP request and change arbitrary user passwords to gain access to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use the reset credentials to gain full control of the application.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Conferencing solution provides functionality that allows organizations to host integrated voice, video, and web conferencing. The solution is deployed on a network and integrated directly into an organization's private voice and data networks and enterprise applications. Cisco Unified MeetingPlace servers can be deployed so that the server is accessible from the Internet, allowing external parties to participate in meetings. Web Conferencing is a core component of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Conferencing solution that allows users to share applications and presentations and manage meetings.


The password change functionality in the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing application could allow an unauthenticated remote, attacker to change the passwords of arbitrary users. The vulnerability is due to the following:

    HTTP session functionality does not validate the session ID in the HTTP request for the password change request.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a crafted HTTP request and change arbitrary user passwords to gain access to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use the reset credentials to gain full control of the application.
