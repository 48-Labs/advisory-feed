    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol subsystem of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly check for certain NULL values present in a Cisco Discovery Protocol packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol  requests to an affected device. The attacker would then need to convince a user to perform a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) poll of the affected MIB. An attacker that can convince a user to perform an SNMP poll of the affected MIB could trigger a NULL pointer error that results in a restart of the device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be on the same collision or broadcast domain as the targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
