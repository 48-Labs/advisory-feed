    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy for FTP and/or Telnet  Sessions feature in specific versions of Cisco IOS software is vulnerable to a  remotely-exploitable buffer overflow condition.

Devices that do not support, or are not configured for Firewall  Authentication Proxy for FTP and/or Telnet Services are not affected.

Devices configured with only Authentication Proxy for HTTP and/or HTTPS  are not affected.

Only devices running certain versions of Cisco  IOSÂ® are affected.

Cisco has made free software available to address this vulnerability.  There are workarounds available to mitigate the effects of the vulnerability.

This advisory will be posted at  https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20050907-auth_proxy ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20050907-auth_proxy"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This section provides details on affected products.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Devices that are running the following release trains of Cisco IOS are  affected if Firewall Authentication Proxy for FTP and/or Telnet Sessions is  configured and applied to an active interface.

   12.2SG, 12.2SEC, 12.2SXF, 12.2SH, 12.2ZF and 12.2ZL based trains

Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software  IOS (tm) 7200 Software (C7200-JK8O3S-M), Version 12.3(10a), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2) Copyright (c) 1986-2004 by cisco Systems, Inc.

Additional information about Cisco IOS release naming can be found at  http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html ["http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html"].

Refer to the Details ["#details"] section for more  information about affected and unaffected configurations.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">These products are not vulnerable:

   Products that are not running Cisco IOS are not affected.

   Products that are running Cisco IOS versions 12.2 and earlier (including 12.0S) are not affected. (excluding those listed).

   Products that are running Cisco IOS are not affected unless they are configured for Firewall Authentication Proxy for FTP and/or Telnet Sessions.

   Products that are running Cisco IOS XR are not affected.


No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this  vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">The Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature allows network  administrators to apply specific security policies on a per-user basis. With  the Firewall Authentication Proxy for FTP and/or Telnet Sessions feature, users  can log into the network services via FTP and/or Telnet, and their specific  access profiles are automatically retrieved and applied from a Remote  Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS), or Terminal Access Controller  Access Control System Plus (TACACS+) authentication server.

Cisco IOS Software is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) and  potentially an arbitrary code execution attack when processing the user  authentication credentials from an Authentication Proxy Telnet/FTP session. To  exploit this vulnerability an attacker must first complete a TCP connection to  the IOS device running affected software and receive an auth-proxy  authentication prompt.



This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug Toolkit as Bug ID  CSCsa54608 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsa54608"]             ( registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only)         .

To determine if your device is running the Firewall Authentication  Proxy for FTP and/or Telnet Sessions feature, log into the device and issue the  show ip auth-proxy configuration command to display  the configuration of Firewall Authentication Proxy services. The following  example identifies Firewall Authentication Proxy services running for Telnet  and FTP under the proxy rule name proxy_example.


Router# show ip auth-proxy configuration 
Authentication global cache time is 60 minutes Authentication global absolute time is 0 minutes Authentication Proxy Watch-list is disabled  Authentication Proxy Rule Configuration Auth-proxy name proxy_example ftp list not specified auth-cache-time 60 minutes telnet list not specified auth-cache-time 60 minutes

The following will be seen if Firewall Authentication Proxy services  are not enabled but supported in your IOS version:


Router# show ip auth-proxy configuration 
Authentication global cache time is 60 minutes Authentication global absolute time is 0 minutes Authentication Proxy Watch-list is disabled  Router#

The following will be seen if running a version of IOS that does not  support Firewall Authentication Proxy services:



Router# show ip auth-proxy configuration                  ^ % Invalid input detected at '^' marker.  Router#

A router that has Firewall Authentication Proxy services assigned to an  interface will have ip auth-proxy list  name  command under an interface in the  show running-config output.

The following example identifies Firewall Authentication Proxy services  running under the proxy rule name "proxy_example" applied to the interface  Ethernet 2/1:


Router# show ip auth-proxy configuration 
Authentication global cache time is 60 minutes Authentication global absolute time is 0 minutes Authentication Proxy Watch-list is disabled  Authentication Proxy Rule Configuration Auth-proxy name proxy_example     ftp list not specified auth-cache-time 60 minutes telnet list not specified auth-cache-time 60 minutes  Router# show running-config . . ! interface Ethernet2/1  ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0  ip auth-proxy proxy_example ! . .

Additional information about Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy  for FTP and/or Telnet Sessions refer to:  http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios123/123newft/123_1/ftp_tel.htm ["/en/US/docs/ios/12_3/feature/guide/ftp_tel.html"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer  situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and  organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,  customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to  ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended  network before it is deployed.

   Disable Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for Telnet/FTP sessions.
In networks where Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for Telnet/FTP sessions is not required but enabled, disabling the feature on an IOS device will eliminate exposure to this vulnerability. On a router which is configured for Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for Telnet/FTP sessions, this must be done by issuing the command:
no ip auth-proxy name 'auth-proxy-name' {ftp | telnet}

   Deploy Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for HTTP/HTTPS sessions.
Configure the device with Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for HTTP and/or HTTPS sessions and allow the Telnet and FTP services within the per-user TACACS+/RADIUS profile. Disable Authentication proxy for Telnet/FTP sessions to eliminate exposure. An example of the configuration statements for HTTP session Auth-proxy is:
! Configure auth-proxy for http session authentication
ip auth-proxy name http-proxy http ! Configure the router's web server to service auth-proxy authentication attempts ip http server ! Set the HTTP server authentication method to AAA ip http authentication aaa
    Additional auth-proxy and web server configuration settings are available. For details see http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios120/120newft/120t/120t5/iosfw2/iosfw2_1.htm ["/en/US/docs/ios/12_0t/12_0t5/feature/guide/iosfw2_1.html"]
After successful authentication via HTTP/HTTPS, the user can initiate required FTP or Telnet sessions. The example shown below for Cisco Secure Windows (TACACS+) server profile Group setting allows FTP and Telnet as part of access-list entry proxyacl#2=permit tcp any any
priv-lvl=15
proxyacl#1=permit icmp any any proxyacl#2=permit tcp any any proxyacl#3=permit udp any any

    Mitigations
 Not all of the mitigation strategies listed will work for all  customers. Some of the workarounds listed are dependent on which versions and  feature-sets of IOS you have in your network. These mitigation strategies, may  help reduce exposure to this vulnerability. To eliminate exposure to this  vulnerability, customers should apply one of the workarounds listed above, or  upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco IOS.

   Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Deploying IP access-lists can mitigate the effects of this vulnerability by allowing Firewall Authentication Proxy access only from trusted subnets. This feature must be used in conjunction with interface access-lists to ensure that IP traffic from un-trusted subnets is dropped by the router and not forwarded around the auth-proxy feature. Once the IP access-list is created, it is applied to the Authentication proxy by adding the keyword list followed by the IP access-list name or number. In the example below the trusted network is 169.160.160.0/24 and the auth-proxy router interface is 10.66.65.47. Example:
! Permit trusted network 169.160.160.0/24 to access auth-proxy
access-list 105 permit tcp 169.160.160.0 0.0.0.255 any eq telnet ! ! Deny all IP traffic that is not authenticated by auth-proxy ! Note: Management and Control traffic to the router itself would  !       need to be allowed in this access-list access-list 106 deny ip any any ! ! Modify the telnet auth-proxy config to use access-list 105 ip auth-proxy name tel-proxy telnet inactivity-time 60 list 105 ! ! Apply interface access-list 106 and auth-proxy test interface FastEthernet1/0 ip address 10.66.65.47 255.255.255.0 ip access-group 106 in ip auth-proxy tel-proxy

   Control Plane Policing
The Control Plane Policy (CoPP) feature can be used to mitigate the effects of this vulnerability by only allowing trusted hosts to attempt connections through the auth-proxy router.
Care must be taken to ensure that legitimate management connections to the auth-proxy router itself are not dropped by the CoPP policy.
In the following example trusted management host 169.160.160.1 is allowed to establish Telnet connections to the auth-proxy router itself.
Trusted network 169.160.160.0/24 is allowed to attempt FTP and Telnet auth-proxy connections to IP networks and addresses other than the auth-proxy router itself. All other inbound FTP and Telnet connections attempts are denied.
The auth-proxy router's IP addresses are 172.16.1.1 (Internet Side), 1.1.1.1/24 and 10.66.65.47 (Internal).
Telnet/FTP server is 172.168.1.1.

 Note: CoPP is available only in IOS release trains 12.0S, 12.2S and   12.3T. Additional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature   can be found at the following URL:   http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps5207/prod_white_papers_list.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps5207/prod_white_papers_list.html"]

   Transit Access Control Lists
Additional mitigation can be added by Transit Access Control Lists that filter transit and edge traffic at network ingress points should be configured so that IP traffic is only allowed from legitimate, trusted IP addresses. For more information on tACLs, refer to:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, please also consult  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisories_listing.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisories_listing.html"]  and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade  solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the  devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and  software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new  release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical  Assistance Center ("TAC") for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) describes a release  train and the platforms or products for which it is intended. If a given  release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible releases that contain  the fix (the "First Fixed Release") and the anticipated date of availability  for each are listed in the "Rebuild" and "Maintenance" columns. A device  running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release in a  specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable.  The release should be upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later  version (greater than or equal to the First Fixed Release label).

      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer  situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and  organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,  customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to  ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended  network before it is deployed.

   Disable Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for Telnet/FTP sessions.
In networks where Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for Telnet/FTP sessions is not required but enabled, disabling the feature on an IOS device will eliminate exposure to this vulnerability. On a router which is configured for Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for Telnet/FTP sessions, this must be done by issuing the command:
no ip auth-proxy name 'auth-proxy-name' {ftp | telnet}

   Deploy Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for HTTP/HTTPS sessions.
Configure the device with Cisco IOS Firewall Authentication Proxy feature for HTTP and/or HTTPS sessions and allow the Telnet and FTP services within the per-user TACACS+/RADIUS profile. Disable Authentication proxy for Telnet/FTP sessions to eliminate exposure. An example of the configuration statements for HTTP session Auth-proxy is:
! Configure auth-proxy for http session authentication
ip auth-proxy name http-proxy http ! Configure the router's web server to service auth-proxy authentication attempts ip http server ! Set the HTTP server authentication method to AAA ip http authentication aaa
    Additional auth-proxy and web server configuration settings are available. For details see http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios120/120newft/120t/120t5/iosfw2/iosfw2_1.htm ["/en/US/docs/ios/12_0t/12_0t5/feature/guide/iosfw2_1.html"]
After successful authentication via HTTP/HTTPS, the user can initiate required FTP or Telnet sessions. The example shown below for Cisco Secure Windows (TACACS+) server profile Group setting allows FTP and Telnet as part of access-list entry proxyacl#2=permit tcp any any
priv-lvl=15
proxyacl#1=permit icmp any any proxyacl#2=permit tcp any any proxyacl#3=permit udp any any

    Mitigations
 Not all of the mitigation strategies listed will work for all  customers. Some of the workarounds listed are dependent on which versions and  feature-sets of IOS you have in your network. These mitigation strategies, may  help reduce exposure to this vulnerability. To eliminate exposure to this  vulnerability, customers should apply one of the workarounds listed above, or  upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco IOS.

   Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Deploying IP access-lists can mitigate the effects of this vulnerability by allowing Firewall Authentication Proxy access only from trusted subnets. This feature must be used in conjunction with interface access-lists to ensure that IP traffic from un-trusted subnets is dropped by the router and not forwarded around the auth-proxy feature. Once the IP access-list is created, it is applied to the Authentication proxy by adding the keyword list followed by the IP access-list name or number. In the example below the trusted network is 169.160.160.0/24 and the auth-proxy router interface is 10.66.65.47. Example:
! Permit trusted network 169.160.160.0/24 to access auth-proxy
access-list 105 permit tcp 169.160.160.0 0.0.0.255 any eq telnet ! ! Deny all IP traffic that is not authenticated by auth-proxy ! Note: Management and Control traffic to the router itself would  !       need to be allowed in this access-list access-list 106 deny ip any any ! ! Modify the telnet auth-proxy config to use access-list 105 ip auth-proxy name tel-proxy telnet inactivity-time 60 list 105 ! ! Apply interface access-list 106 and auth-proxy test interface FastEthernet1/0 ip address 10.66.65.47 255.255.255.0 ip access-group 106 in ip auth-proxy tel-proxy

   Control Plane Policing
The Control Plane Policy (CoPP) feature can be used to mitigate the effects of this vulnerability by only allowing trusted hosts to attempt connections through the auth-proxy router.
Care must be taken to ensure that legitimate management connections to the auth-proxy router itself are not dropped by the CoPP policy.
In the following example trusted management host 169.160.160.1 is allowed to establish Telnet connections to the auth-proxy router itself.
Trusted network 169.160.160.0/24 is allowed to attempt FTP and Telnet auth-proxy connections to IP networks and addresses other than the auth-proxy router itself. All other inbound FTP and Telnet connections attempts are denied.
The auth-proxy router's IP addresses are 172.16.1.1 (Internet Side), 1.1.1.1/24 and 10.66.65.47 (Internal).
Telnet/FTP server is 172.168.1.1.

 Note: CoPP is available only in IOS release trains 12.0S, 12.2S and   12.3T. Additional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature   can be found at the following URL:   http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps5207/prod_white_papers_list.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps5207/prod_white_papers_list.html"]

   Transit Access Control Lists
Additional mitigation can be added by Transit Access Control Lists that filter transit and edge traffic at network ingress points should be configured so that IP traffic is only allowed from legitimate, trusted IP addresses. For more information on tACLs, refer to:
