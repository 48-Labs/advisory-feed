  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability within the firewall configuration of the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Enterprise Module (APIC-EM) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain privileged access to services only available on the internal network of the device.

The vulnerability is due to an incorrect firewall rule on the device. The misconfiguration could allow traffic sent to the public interface of the device to be forwarded to the internal virtual network of the APIC-EM. An attacker that is logically adjacent to the network on which the public interface of the affected APIC-EM resides could leverage this behavior to gain access to services listening on the internal network with elevated privileges.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects appliances or virtual devices running Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Enterprise Module prior to version 1.5.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco APIC-EM release 1.5 or later.

The software can be downloaded from the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html"] on Cisco.com by navigating to Downloads &gt;  Home &gt; Products &gt; Cloud and Systems Management &gt; Policy and Automation Controllers &gt; Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Enterprise Module (APIC-EM) &gt; APIC-EM Software Updates-1.5</cvrf:Note>
