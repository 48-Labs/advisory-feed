    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper storage of sensitive information within the web UI of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based phone loads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to the IP address of a device that has Web Access enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information, including incoming and outgoing call records.

Note: Web Access is disabled by default.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-phone-infodisc-sbyqQVbG ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-phone-infodisc-sbyqQVbG"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco SIP IP Phone Software and had Web Access enabled:

Desk Phone 9800 Series
IP Phone 7800 Series
IP Phone 8800 Series (except Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821)
Video Phone 8875

The Web Access feature is disabled by default.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
  Determine Whether Web Access Is Enabled
Web Access is disabled by default on Cisco phones. If a user can browse to the IP address listed in the phone configuration by following these steps, Web Access has been enabled:

Choose the gear icon on the front of the phone to access the phone configuration and determine the IP address of the phone.
Choose Admin settings &gt; Network Setup &gt; Ethernet setup or Wi-Fi client setup &gt; IPv4 setup.
Type the IP address in a browser window and click Enter.

If the Device Information screen is displayed, then Web Access is enabled on the phone.

To enable or disable Web Access, follow these steps:


Log in to the Communications Manager to which the phone is registered using Admin privileges, which allow modification of devices.
Choose Device &gt; Phone.
Type in the search criteria and choose Find.
Choose the appropriate device from the Device Name list.
Scroll down to Web Access, toggle between Enabled or Disabled as desired, and click Save.
Verify that the desired state has been set by typing the IP address into a browser window and clicking Enter.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series or 8800 Series phones that are running Cisco Multiplatform Firmware.</cvrf:Note>

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
