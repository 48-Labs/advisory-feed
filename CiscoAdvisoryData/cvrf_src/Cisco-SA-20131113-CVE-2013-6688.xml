    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the license upload interface of the Cisco Enterprise License Manager (ELM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the path provided in the license upload interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to write files in arbitrary locations on the filesystem.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to authenticate to the targeted device, which decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that proof-of-concept exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
