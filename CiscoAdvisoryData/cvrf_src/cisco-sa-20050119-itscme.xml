  Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOSÂ®) Software release trains
	 12.1YD, 12.2T, 12.3 and 12.3T, when configured for the Cisco IOS Telephony
	 Service (ITS), Cisco CallManager Express (CME) or Survivable Remote Site
	 Telephony (SRST) may contain a vulnerability in processing certain malformed
	 control protocol messages.
 
   A successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause a reload of
	 the device and could be exploited repeatedly to produce a Denial of Service
	 (DoS). This advisory is available at
	 https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20050119-itscme["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20050119-itscme"]


  
  Cisco has made free software upgrades available to address this
	 vulnerability for all affected customers. There are workarounds available to
	 mitigate the effects of the vulnerability.
 
  This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID CSCee08584.

  This section provides details on affected products.




</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">



 
   This issue affects all Cisco devices running any unfixed version of
	 Cisco IOS code that supports, and is configured for ITS, CME or SRST. 
 
   A Cisco device running ITS or CME will have the following line in the
	 configuration:
 
  
telephony-service
 
  A Cisco device running SRST will have the following line in the
	 configuration:
 
  
call-manager-fallback
 
  To determine the software running on a Cisco product, log in to the
	 device and issue the show version command to display
	 the system banner. Cisco IOS Software will identify itself as "Internetwork
	 Operating System Software" or simply "IOS." On the next line of output, the
	 image name will be displayed between parentheses, followed by "Version" and the
	 IOS release name. Other Cisco devices will not have the show
	 version command or will give different output. 
 
   The following example identifies a Cisco product running IOS release
	 12.0(3) with an installed image name of C2500-IS-L:
 
  
Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software IOS (TM)
    
2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.0(3), RELEASE SOFTWARE

 
  The release train label is "12.0". 
 
  The next example shows a product running IOS release 12.3(6) with an
	 image name of C2600-JS-MZ: 
 
  
Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software IOS (tm)

C2600 Software (C2600-JS-MZ), Version 12.3(6), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

  ITS, CME and SRST are features that allow a Cisco device running IOS to
	 control IP Phones using the Skinny Call Control Protocol (SCCP). SCCP is the
	 Cisco CallManager native signaling protocol.
 
  Certain malformed packets sent to the SCCP port on an IOS device
	 configured for ITS, CME or SRST may cause the target device to reload. This
	 issue is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCee08584.
 
  The following commands can be used to determine if ITS or CME are
	 running. A device that does not have ITS or CME enabled will display:
 
  
Router#show telephony-service
telephony-service is not enabled
 
  A device that has ITS or CME enabled will show something similar
	 to:
 
  
Router#show telephony-service

  Spoofed attacks are impractical since the attacker must pass all of the
	 TCP/IP integrity checks first, including the initial sequence number and source
	 TCP port number.
 



 

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">




 
  The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer
	 situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and
	 organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,
	 customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to
	 ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended
	 network before it is deployed.
 
  Affected devices that must run ITS, CME or SRST are vulnerable, and
	 there are not any specific configurations that can be used to protect them.
	 Applying access lists on interfaces that should not accept ITS, CME or SRST
	 traffic and putting firewalls in strategic locations may greatly reduce
	 exposure until an upgrade can be performed.
 
  The IP Telephony Security in Depth SAFE paper at the URL below
	 discusses a variety of best practices that should keep your voice network
	 isolated from the Internet. These best practices may help to reduce the risk of
	 exposure, although attacks from within the local network should always be
	 considered a potential risk.
 
  
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns171/ns128/networking_solutions_white_papers_list.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns744/networking_solutions_program_home.html"]


  

Using 'strict-match' 
  It is possible to restrict SCCP communications to the IP specified in
	 the ip source-address configuration command by using
	 the 
strict-match
 option. More
	 information on this command can be found at the following URL:
 
  
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns165/ns391/networking_solutions_design_guidance09186a00801f8e30.html#wp40333["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns165/ns391/networking_solutions_design_guidance09186a00801f8e30.html#wp40333"]


  

Using Access Lists 
   Where possible, it is recommended to block SCCP traffic at the network
	 edge with an Infrastructure Access Control List (iACL) or a Transit Access
	 Control List (tACL).
 
   For more information on iACLs, refer to "Protecting Your Core:
	 Infrastructure Protecton Access Control Lists":
 
  
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html["/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"]


  
   For more information on tACLs, refer to 'Transit Access Control Lists:
	 Filtering at Your Edge":
 
  
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/tacl.html["/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml"]


  
   Below is an example of an access list to block SCCP traffic from
	 anywhere but a permitted network.
 
   
	 
Note:  In SRST deployments the SCCP packets are not addressed directly to
		the SRST device. The SCCP packets will be addressed to the call control devices
		(typically Cisco CallManager). 
 
   
   In this example, the permitted telephony devices are on the
	 172.16.0.0/16 network and the SCCP port being used is the default, TCP port
	 2000. If the specific IP addresses of the telephony devices are known, then the
	 access list can be made to restrict traffic from only those devices.
 
  


!--- Permit access from any IP address in the 172.16.0.0/16 
!--- to TCP port 2000.


access-list 101 permit tcp 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 any eq 2000


!--- Deny all traffic to port 2000.


access-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 2000


!--- Permit all other traffic.


access-list 101 permit ip any any
 

Using Control Plane Policing 
   The Control Plane Policing (CoPP) feature may be used to mitigate this
	 vulnerability. In the following example SCCP traffic is permitted to and from
	 the 192.168.10.0/24 subnet. All other TCP port 2000 traffic destined to the
	 device is blocked.
 
  
access-list 140 deny   tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 2000
access-list 140 deny   tcp any 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 2000
access-list 140 permit tcp any any eq 2000
access-list 140 deny   ip  any any

   CoPP is available in IOS release trains 12.2S and 12.3T. Additional
	 information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found at
	 the following URL:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">




 
  Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) describes a release
	 train and the platforms or products for which it is intended. If a given
	 release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible releases that contain
	 the fix (the "First Fixed Release") and the anticipated date of availability
	 for each are listed in the "Rebuild" and "Maintenance" columns. A device
	 running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release in a
	 specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable.
	 The release should be upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later
	 version (greater than or equal to the First Fixed Release label). 
 
  For further information on the terms "Rebuild" and "Maintenance" please
	 consult the following URL:
 
  
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html["http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html"]


  
   When considering software upgrades, please also consult
	 http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisories_listing.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisories_listing.html"]
	 and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade
	 solution. 
 
   In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
	 devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and
	 software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new
	 release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical
	 Assistance Center ("TAC") for asssistance.

      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>




 
  The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer
	 situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and
	 organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,
	 customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to
	 ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended
	 network before it is deployed.
 
  Affected devices that must run ITS, CME or SRST are vulnerable, and
	 there are not any specific configurations that can be used to protect them.
	 Applying access lists on interfaces that should not accept ITS, CME or SRST
	 traffic and putting firewalls in strategic locations may greatly reduce
	 exposure until an upgrade can be performed.
 
  The IP Telephony Security in Depth SAFE paper at the URL below
	 discusses a variety of best practices that should keep your voice network
	 isolated from the Internet. These best practices may help to reduce the risk of
	 exposure, although attacks from within the local network should always be
	 considered a potential risk.

Using 'strict-match' 
  It is possible to restrict SCCP communications to the IP specified in
	 the ip source-address configuration command by using
	 the 
strict-match
 option. More
	 information on this command can be found at the following URL:
 
  
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns165/ns391/networking_solutions_design_guidance09186a00801f8e30.html#wp40333["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns165/ns391/networking_solutions_design_guidance09186a00801f8e30.html#wp40333"]


  

Using Access Lists 
   Where possible, it is recommended to block SCCP traffic at the network
	 edge with an Infrastructure Access Control List (iACL) or a Transit Access
	 Control List (tACL).
 
   For more information on iACLs, refer to "Protecting Your Core:
	 Infrastructure Protecton Access Control Lists":
 
  
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html["/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"]


  
   For more information on tACLs, refer to 'Transit Access Control Lists:
	 Filtering at Your Edge":
 
  
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/tacl.html["/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml"]


  
   Below is an example of an access list to block SCCP traffic from
	 anywhere but a permitted network.
 
   
	 
Note:  In SRST deployments the SCCP packets are not addressed directly to
		the SRST device. The SCCP packets will be addressed to the call control devices
		(typically Cisco CallManager). 
 
   
   In this example, the permitted telephony devices are on the
	 172.16.0.0/16 network and the SCCP port being used is the default, TCP port
	 2000. If the specific IP addresses of the telephony devices are known, then the
	 access list can be made to restrict traffic from only those devices.
 
  


!--- Permit access from any IP address in the 172.16.0.0/16 
!--- to TCP port 2000.


access-list 101 permit tcp 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 any eq 2000


!--- Deny all traffic to port 2000.


access-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 2000


!--- Permit all other traffic.


access-list 101 permit ip any any
 

Using Control Plane Policing 
   The Control Plane Policing (CoPP) feature may be used to mitigate this
	 vulnerability. In the following example SCCP traffic is permitted to and from
	 the 192.168.10.0/24 subnet. All other TCP port 2000 traffic destined to the
	 device is blocked.
 
  
access-list 140 deny   tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 2000
access-list 140 deny   tcp any 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 2000
access-list 140 permit tcp any any eq 2000
access-list 140 deny   ip  any any

   CoPP is available in IOS release trains 12.2S and 12.3T. Additional
	 information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found at
