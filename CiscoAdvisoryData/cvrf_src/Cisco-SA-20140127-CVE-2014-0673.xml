  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web user interface of the Cisco Video Surveillance 5000 Series HD IP Dome Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.



The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted URL.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerabilities in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">
Customers are advised to consult Cisco bug IDs IDCSCud10943["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud10943"] and CSCud10950["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud10950"] for the most complete list of affected product versions.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">At the time this alert was first published, Cisco Video Surveillance 5000 Series HD IP Dome Camera Firmware version 1.6 (.17) is vulnerable. Other versions of Cisco Video Surveillance 5000 Series HD IP Dome Camera Firmware may also be affected.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Administrators are advised to contact the vendor regarding future updates and releases.



Users are advised not to visit websites or follow links that have suspicious characteristics or cannot be verified as safe.
