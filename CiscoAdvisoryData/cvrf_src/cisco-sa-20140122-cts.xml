    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">A vulnerability in System Status Collection Daemon (SSCD) code   could
allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary
commands with the privilege of the root user.



The vulnerability
is due to improper validation of parameters passed to the SSCD code via
an XML-remote procedure call (RPC). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted
XML-RPC messages. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary calls via stack corruption with the privilege of the root user.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCui32796["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui32796"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-0661.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
