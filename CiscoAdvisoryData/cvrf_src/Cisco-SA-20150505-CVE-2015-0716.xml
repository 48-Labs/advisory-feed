    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the CUCReports page of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against the CUCReports web interface.

 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections on the Cisco Unity Connection web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to convince the user to follow the link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco has released bug ID CSCut33659["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCut33659"] for registered users that contains additional details and an up-to-date list of affected product versions.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">At the time this alert was first published, Cisco Unity Connection versions 11.0(0.98000.225) and 11.0(0.98000.332) were vulnerable. Other versions may also be affected.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Users should verify that unsolicited links are safe to follow.



For additional information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigation methods, see the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28726"].
