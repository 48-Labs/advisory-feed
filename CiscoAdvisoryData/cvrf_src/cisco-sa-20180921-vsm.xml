    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Video Surveillance Manager (VSM) Software running on certain Cisco Connected Safety and Security Unified Computing System (UCS) platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to an affected system by using the root account, which has default, static user credentials.

The vulnerability is due to the presence of undocumented, default, static user credentials for the root account of the affected software on certain systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected system and execute arbitrary commands as the root user.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180921-vsm ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180921-vsm"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Video Surveillance Manager (VSM) Software Releases 7.10, 7.11, and 7.11.1 if the software was preinstalled by Cisco and is running on the following Cisco Connected Safety and Security Unified Computing System (UCS) platforms:

CPS-UCSM4-1RU-K9
CPS-UCSM4-2RU-K9
KIN-UCSM5-1RU-K9
KIN-UCSM5-2RU-K9
  Determine the Platform
To determine whether Cisco VSM Software is running on the Cisco Connected Safety and Security UCS platform, administrators can do the following:

Log in to Cisco Video Surveillance Operations Manager
Choose System Settings &gt; Server
Click the General tab

The value in the Model field indicates which platform the software is running on. If the value is VMware Virtual Platform, the system is not vulnerable. If the value is the bare-metal hardware product ID, the software is running on the Cisco Connected Safety and Security UCS platform. If the product ID matches the product ID of a vulnerable platform ["#vp"], the system may be vulnerable, depending on which Cisco VSM Software release is running on the system and whether Cisco preinstalled the software.
  Determine the Cisco VSM Release
To determine which Cisco VSM Software release is running on a system, administrators can do the following:

Log in to Cisco Video Surveillance Operations Manager
Choose System Settings &gt; Server
Click the General tab

The value in the SW Version field indicates which Cisco VSM Software release is running on the system. If the value is 7.10.0-xxx, 7.11.0-xxx, or 7.11.1-xxx, the system may be vulnerable, depending on which platform the software is running on.

The software release number also appears on the Cisco Video Surveillance Operations Manager log in page.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect:

Cisco VSM Software Releases 7.9 and earlier
Cisco VSM Software Releases 7.10, 7.11, and 7.11.1 running on CPS-UCSM4-1RU-K9 and CPS-UCSM4-1RU-K9 platforms if Cisco VSM Software Release 7.9 or earlier was preinstalled on the platform by Cisco and the software was subsequently upgraded to Release 7.10, 7.11, or 7.11.1 by the customer
Cisco VSM Software that is running on the VMware ESXi platform</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">This vulnerability exists because the root account of the affected software was not disabled before Cisco installed the software on the vulnerable platforms, and default, static user credentials exist for the account. The user credentials are not documented publicly.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
  Fixed Releases
Cisco fixed this vulnerability in Cisco VSM Software Release 7.12.

Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:
                                Cisco VSM Release              First Fixed Release                                              Prior to 7.9                          Not vulnerable                                              7.9              Not vulnerable                                              7.10              Vulnerable, contact the Cisco TAC                                              7.11                           Vulnerable, contact the Cisco TAC                                              7.12              Not vulnerable
Customers who do not want to upgrade to Cisco VSM Software Release 7.12 should contact the Cisco TAC for further assistance.
