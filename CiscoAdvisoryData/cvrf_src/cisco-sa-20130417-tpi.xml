    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco TelePresence multipoint control unit (MCU) and Cisco TelePresence Server contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger the reload of an affected system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130417-tpi["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130417-tpi"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following Cisco TelePresence Infrastructure products are affected by this vulnerability:


    Cisco TelePresence MCU 4501 Series, MCU 4500 Series and Cisco TelePresence MCU MSE 8510 versions 4.3(2.18) and earlier
    Cisco TelePresence Server versions 2.2(1.54) and earlier
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following Cisco TelePresence MCU products are not affected by this vulnerability:


    Cisco TelePresence MCU 5300 Series and MCU 4200 Series 
    Cisco TelePresence MCU MSE 8420 

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco TelePresence Infrastructure offers a wide range of products to scale and manage the Cisco TelePresence solution. The Cisco TelePresence Infrastructure solution includes MCU products includes Cisco TelePresence MCU products which are a range of advanced MCUs that are designed to combine continuous presence with high-definition video and voice quality, and Cisco TelePresence Server which connects users to a wide range of
endpoints and multivendor telepresence systems.



A vulnerability in the digital signal processor (DSP) card could allow
an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the DSP card which will
trigger a reload of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due
to insufficient validation of a malformed H.264 bit stream that is transported in a Real-Time Transport Protocol
(RTP) packet payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
injecting RTP packets with a malformed H.264 bit stream into an established Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) or H.323 session. An exploit could allow the attacker to
cause the reload of the affected system.



This vulnerability is described in Cisco bug IDs CSCuc11328["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc11328"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence Server and CSCub05448["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub05448"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence MCU Series devices. This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Identifier CVE-2013-1176.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">No workarounds are available that mitigate this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">This vulnerability has been resolved in the following system versions:


    Cisco TelePresence MCU 4500 Series, MCU 4501 Series and Cisco TelePresence MCU MSE 8510  versions 4.3(2.30) and later
    Cisco TelePresence Server versions 2.3(1.55) and later




When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
