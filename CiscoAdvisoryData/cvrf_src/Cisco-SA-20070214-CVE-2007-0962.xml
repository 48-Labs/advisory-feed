  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Firewall Services Module, Cisco PIX Security Appliance, and Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. 

The vulnerability exists due to an error within the handling of malformed HTTP requests.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via a malformed HTTP request to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco confirmed this vulnerability in a security advisory and released updated software.





Enhanced inspection of HTTP requests is not enabled by default on any of the affected products.  Normal inspection, which is enabled by using the inspect http command without specifying an HTTP map, will not make a system vulnerable.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco has released a security advisory to address Cisco bug ID CSCsd75794["http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/onebug.pl?bugid=CSCsd75794"] at the following link: cisco-sa-20070214-fwsm["http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070214-fwsm.shtml"] for Cisco Firewall Services Module.

Cisco has released a security advisory to address Cisco bug ID CSCsd75794["http://www.cisco.com/cgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/onebug.pl?bugid=CSCsd75794"] at the following link: cisco-sa-20070214-pix ["http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070214-pix.shtml"]for Cisco PIX and ASA appliances.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Systems running the following versions of Cisco Firewall Services Module are vulnerable: 


Cisco Firewall Services Module Versions 3.0 prior to 3.1(3.24)

Cisco PIX 500 Series Security Appliances and Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are vulnerable if they are using the following software releases:


Versions 7.0 prior to 7.0(4.14)
Versions 7.1 prior to 7.1(2.1)
Versions 7.2 prior to 7.2(1)
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate patch. 

Administrators may wish to disable enhanced inspection of HTTP traffic by removing the line inspect http %appfw% from the configuration, where appfw is the name of an HTTP map.  However, this will result in a less granular inspection of HTTP traffic.  If this is done, inspect http should be left configured because it will still provide some protection against malicious HTTP requests.

The Cisco Applied Intelligence team has created the following companion document to guide administrators in identifying and mitigating attempts to exploit this vulnerability prior to applying updated software: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA/PIX/FWSM Firewalls["http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20070214-firewall.shtml"]
