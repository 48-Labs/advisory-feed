    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">On March 9, 2015, new research was published that takes advantage of a flaw in double data rate type 3 (DDR3) synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) to perform privilege escalation attacks on systems that contain the affected hardware. The flaw is known as Row Hammer. To attempt an attack, the attacker must execute a malicious binary on an affected system.



In addition, the research focused on consumer hardware that did not have a number of mitigations and memory protections that have been integrated into chipsets and memory modules used in Cisco server-class products. Of note in the paper is that the researchers were unable, in their testing, to exploit devices that use Error-Correcting Code (ECC) memory.



Cisco offers a limited number of products that allow an unprivileged user to load and execute binaries.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco offers a limited number of products that allow an unprivileged user to load and execute binaries. The products in the following list allow users to load and execute binaries and are currently under investigation. Each of the following products contains a number of hardware protections against Row Hammer events, including ECC memory modules. Based on the initial research report, there is no reason to believe any Cisco products would be affected. However, Cisco is testing against the following products to confirm.



Update (March 30th, 2015): The evaluation of Cisco devices has shown that this issue is not exploitable on devices that are equipped with ECC DDRAM and have the ECC checking options enabled in their BIOS. This is the default state on all evaluated products.  All Cisco UCS computing devices have been found to be not affected by the Row Hammer Privilege Escalation attack as shipped from Cisco.  Validation has been performed on all Cisco UCS devices utilizing Cisco qualified Dual-Inline Memory Modules.  DIMM devices that have been installed in a UCS computing device that are not Cisco qualified parts may be affected.</cvrf:Note>

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Row Hammer DDR3 Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
On March 9, 2015, new research and findings related to a previously known issue discovered in the DDR3 memory specification were released. The new research takes advantage of a class of DDR3 memory limitations called Row Hammer. The Row Hammer issue was first recognized in the industry on a large scale in 2012 when high-performance computing was increasing demands on DDR3-based systems and triggering failures. The typical failure case at the time involved memory corruption and subsequent device crashes. Both memory manufacturers and chipset vendors began building mitigations for Row Hammer into their parts.



The research report is here:

http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html["http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html"]



The latest research shows that these types of errors can be introduced in a predictable manner. A proof of concept that runs on the Linux operating system has been released that uses the predictability of these errors to modify the memory of affected devices from an unprivileged context. This capability may be used by an authenticated, local attacker who can execute an attacker-supplied binary to elevate the attacker's privileges to that of a superuser or root account.



Because the attacker must execute a binary to trigger this issue, only Cisco products that allow unprivileged local user access as well as the ability to execute a binary may be affected.



The research specifies that researchers were unable to demonstrate an impact on ECC-equipped products.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">No direct workarounds or remediations are available to mitigate this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</cvrf:Note>
