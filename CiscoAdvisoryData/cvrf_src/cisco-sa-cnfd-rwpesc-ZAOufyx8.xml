    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">CVE-2024-20326

This vulnerability affects ConfD.

For information about which ConfD software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.

CVE-2024-20389

This vulnerability affects ConfD Release 8.0.11. All other software releases are not affected.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2024-20326: ConfD Arbitrary File Read and Write Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the ConfD CLI could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, local attacker to read and write arbitrary files as root on the underlying operating system.

This vulnerability is due to improper authorization enforcement when specific CLI commands are used. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing an affected CLI command with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the root user.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Tail-f, a Cisco company, has released software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have a current license and have a valid support and maintenance agreement. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of their license agreement with Tail-f Systems AB. Security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license or additional software feature sets.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

Customers who have a current license and have a valid support and maintenance agreement can download the fixed version of software from their existing Tail-f delivery server download account.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to open a support ticket in the Tail-f Support system.
