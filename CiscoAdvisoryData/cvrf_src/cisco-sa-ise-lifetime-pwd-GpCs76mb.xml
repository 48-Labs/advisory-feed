    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">An issue in the Password Policy settings of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an administrator to use expired credentials to gain access to the web management interface.

When the Password Lifetime setting for the administrator password policy is used to set the password to expire, the password does not expire. As a result, an administrator could use expired credentials to log in to the web management interface and have the same level of privileges as before the password expired. No additional privileges would be gained, and valid credentials would be required.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-lifetime-pwd-GpCs76mb ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-lifetime-pwd-GpCs76mb"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this issue affected Cisco ISE if it had Password Lifetime enabled.

Cisco is tracking this issue in Cisco bug ID CSCvy74919 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy74919"].

For information about which Cisco software releases were affected at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) for the most complete and current information.

Determine Whether Password Lifetime Is Enabled

To determine whether Password Lifetime is enabled, do the following:

Log in to the Cisco ISE web management interface.
For Cisco ISE releases 3.0 and 3.1, click the menu icon. For earlier versions of Cisco ISE, skip this step.
Choose Administration &gt; System &gt; Admin Access.
Click the Password Policy tab.
Scroll to the Password Lifetime section.
If the Administrator passwords expire n days after creation or last change check box is checked, the Password Lifetime feature is enabled.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">To manually disable an administrative account at the time it expires, do the following:

Log in to the Cisco ISE web management interface.
For Cisco ISE releases 3.0 and 3.1, click the menu icon. For earlier versions of Cisco ISE, skip this step.
Choose Administration &gt; System &gt; Admin Access.
Choose Administrators &gt; Admin Users from the menu on the right.
Check the box next to the appropriate administrator account and click Edit.
In the Status drop-down menu, choose Disabled.
Click Save.

While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
