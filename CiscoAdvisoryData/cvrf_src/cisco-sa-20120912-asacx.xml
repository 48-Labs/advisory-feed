    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco ASA-CX Context-Aware Security appliance and Cisco Prime Security Manager (PRSM) contain a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in versions prior to 9.0.2-103.



Successful exploitation of this vulnerability on the Cisco ASA-CX could cause the device to stop processing user traffic and prevent management access to the Cisco ASA-CX.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability on the Cisco PRSM could cause the software to become unresponsive and unavailable.



There are no workarounds for this vulnerability, but some mitigations are available.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120912-asacx["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120912-asacx"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2"></cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">

All versions of Cisco ASA-CX Content-Aware Security and Cisco PRSM software prior to 9.0.2-103 are affected by the vulnerability in this advisory.





Determining Cisco ASA-CX Context-Aware Security and Cisco Prime Security Manager Software Versions



To determine the running version of Cisco ASA-CX software, issue the show version command from the Cisco ASA-CX command line interface, to which an administrator can get access via serial console, SSH session to the ASA-CX management interface, or a session opened from the parent ASA using the session command.




The following example shows Cisco ASA-CX software Version 9.0.1(40) and Cisco PRSM Version 9.0.1(40):



	asacx&gt; show version
	Cisco ASA CX Platform  9.0.1 (40)
	Cisco Prime Security Manager 9.0.1 (40)


Customers using Cisco PRSM to manage Cisco ASA-CX devices can locate the software version of Cisco ASA-CX in the Device &gt; Devices part of the Cisco Prime Security Manager window.





To determine the running version of Cisco PRSM software, issue the show version command from the Cisco PRSM command line interface, to which an administrator can get access to via PRSM VMware console, or SSH session to the Cisco PRSM management interface.



The following example shows Cisco PRSM software Version 9.0.1(40):



	prsm&gt; show version
	Cisco Prime Security Manager 9.0.1 (40) Multi Device prsm-vm





Customers using HTTPS to access Cisco PRSM can locate the software version of Cisco PRSM in the Administration &gt; About PRSM part of the Cisco Prime Security Manager window.





</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco ASA Services Module (ASA-SM) and Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Firewall Services Module (FWSM) are not affected by this vulnerability.



No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability. 


</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">The Cisco ASA CX Context-Aware Security is an add-on services module that extends the ASA platform with context-aware capabilities for additional visibility and control.

The Cisco Prime Security Manager (PRSM) is the multi-device management platform for Cisco ASA-CX.



The Cisco ASA-CX and Cisco PRSM contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.



An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain types of IPv4 packets to the management interface of the Cisco ASA-CX or Cisco PRSM. As a result, the log files grow and consume the /var/log partition. Once the /var/log partition is full, the Cisco ASA-CX module or Cisco PRSM will become unresponsive.



Successful exploitation on a Cisco ASA-CX device could cause the Cisco ASA-CX to become unresponsive and stop processing user traffic. 

Successful exploitation on a Cisco PRSM software could cause the Cisco PRSM to become unresponsive.



Only user traffic specifically directed towards the Cisco ASA-CX by the Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the parent Cisco ASA is affected by the vulnerability in this advisory. 

Management traffic from Cisco PRSM to Cisco ASA-CX is also affected by this vulnerability.





How to determine if the vulnerability has been exploited



To determine if the vulnerability has been exploited on the affected device, issue the show diskusage command from the command line interface.



The following example shows the output of an affected Cisco ASA-CX or Cisco PRSM where /var/log utilization has reached 100% of use:



	asacx&gt;show diskusage

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub70603["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub70603"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco ASA-CX Context-Aware Security and Cisco Prime Security Manager and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4629. 




</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.



If the vulnerability has been exploited on the Cisco ASA-CX and the traffic is interrupted, as a mitigation, Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the Cisco ASA that is used to direct the user traffic towards the Cisco ASA-CX can be removed. This will cause all user traffic to bypass Cisco ASA-CX module inspection and allow it to pass through the Cisco ASA.



The following example shows how to disable the redirecting of web traffic to the Cisco ASA-CX from the Cisco ASA firewall:





hostname(config)# class-map http_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 80
hostname(config)# policy-map http_traffic_policy
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# no cxsc



There are no similar mitigations available for Cisco Prime Security Manager.
