    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the restricted security domain implementation of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read, modify, or delete non-tenant policies (for example, access policies) created by users associated with a different security domain on an affected system.

This vulnerability is due to improper access control when restricted security domains are used to implement multi-tenancy for policies outside the tenant boundaries. An attacker with a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete policies created by users associated with a different security domain. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apic-uapa-F4TAShk ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apic-uapa-F4TAShk"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco APIC when restricted security domains were configured.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
  Determine Restricted Security Domain Configuration
To determine whether restricted security domains are configured, run the moquery -c aaaDomain -f 'aaa.Domain.restrictedRbacDomain=="yes"' | egrep dn command at the device CLI, as shown in the following example:


apic1-mdr1# moquery -c aaaDomain -f 'aaa.Domain.restrictedRbacDomain=="yes"' | egrep dn
dn                   : uni/userext/domain-test1
dn                   : uni/userext/domain-test2

If no entries are returned, the configuration is not affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Cloud Network Controller.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Restricted security domains are used to provide multi-tenancy capabilities in policies and profiles outside of the tenant level. Even if these policies and profiles do not belong to any tenant, by using separated restricted security domains for each tenant, users from each tenant can create policies and profiles that are hidden to users in other tenants.

For more information about restricting access using security domains, see the Cisco APIC Security Configuration Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/6x/security-configuration/cisco-apic-security-configuration-guide-60x/restricting-access-using-security-domains-and-node-rules-60x.html?cachemode=refresh"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
