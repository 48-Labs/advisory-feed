    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted data in a command parameter to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system, which could be leveraged to conduct further attacks.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.
