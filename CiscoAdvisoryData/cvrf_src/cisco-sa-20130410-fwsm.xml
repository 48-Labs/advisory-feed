    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) Software for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers is affected by the following vulnerabilities:



    
    FWSM HTTP Proxy Traceback Vulnerability
    
    
    IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability
    

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is
affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the
other.



Successful exploitation of either of these vulnerabilities may result in a
reload of an affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. A workaround is available for the IKE
vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130410-fwsm["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130410-fwsm"]





Note: The
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) may be affected by some of the
vulnerabilities listed above. A separate Cisco Security Advisory has
been published to disclose the vulnerabilities that affect the Cisco ASA. That advisory is available at:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130410-asa["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130410-asa"]

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco Firewall Service Module Software for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco
7600 Series Routers is affected by
multiple vulnerabilities. Affected versions of Cisco FWSM Software will
vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the "Software
Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more
information about the affected versions.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">FWSM HTTP Proxy Traceback Vulnerability
A Cisco FWSM is affected by this vulnerability when running an affected version of Cisco FWSM Software with the auth-proxy feature configured.  The auth-proxy feature is not enabled by default.  See the "Details" section for information on determining whether a device has a vulnerable configuration.



IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability
A Cisco FWSM is affected by this vulnerability if IKE
version 1 is enabled.  IKE is not enabled by default.  See the "Details" section for information on determining whether a device has a vulnerable configuration.

Note: IKE on the FWSM is supported only for remote administration, not for remote network access.  
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">With the exception of Cisco ASA software, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">FWSM HTTP Proxy Traceback Vulnerability
The auth-proxy feature in Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) Software contains
a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause a reload of an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of URLs when clients are making requests through the auth-proxy feature.  A Cisco FWSM is affected by this vulnerability when running an affected
version of Cisco FWSM Software with the auth-proxy feature configured.  The auth-proxy
feature is enabled if the configuration contains one or more of the
the following commands:
aaa authentication {include | exclude} service  interface_name inside_ip inside_mask [outside_ip 
outside_mask] {server_tag | LOCAL}



or


aaa authentication match acl_name  interface_name {server_tag | LOCAL}


The auth-proxy feature is not enabled by default.  See the Cisco FWSM configuration guide for more examples http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/fwsm/fwsm31/configuration/guide/fwaaa_f.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/fwsm/fwsm31/configuration/guide/fwaaa_f.html"]

This vulnerability is described in Cisco bug ID CSCtg02624["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtg02624"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1155.



IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability
Note: IKE on the Cisco FWSM is supported only for remote administration, not for remote network access.  



A Cisco FWSM is affected by this vulnerability if IKE
version 1 is enabled. IKE version 1 is enabled if the command isakmp enable  is configured



IKE is not enabled by default.



This vulnerability is described in Cisco bug ID CSCud20267["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud20267"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1149.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Administrators can mitigate the  IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability by disabling VPN access for administration and instead using SSH or HTTPS for administration.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
