    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the EAP-FAST authentication module of Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) versions 4.0 through 4.2.1.15 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Cisco Secure ACS server. This vulnerability is only present when Cisco Secure ACS is configured as a RADIUS server.



The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of user identities used for EAP-FAST authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted EAP-FAST packets to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Cisco Secure ACS server and take full control of the affected server.



There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2"></cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco Secure ACS for Windows versions 4.0 through 4.2.1.15 are affected by this vulnerability when configured as a RADIUS server with EAP-FAST authentication.

Cisco Secure ACS, when configured as TACACS+ server only, does not support the EAP-FAST authentication method, and is not vulnerable.


</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco Secure Access Control Server Express, Cisco Secure Access Control Server View, and Cisco Secure Access Control System are not affected by this vulnerability. 

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco Secure ACS operates as a centralized RADIUS and TACACS+ server, combining user authentication, user and administrator device access control, and policy control into a centralized identity networking solution.



A vulnerability in the EAP-FAST authentication module of Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) versions 4.0 through 4.2.1.15 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Cisco Secure ACS server. This vulnerability is only present when Cisco Secure ACS is configured as a RADIUS server.



The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of user identities used for EAP-FAST authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted EAP-FAST packets to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Cisco Secure ACS server and take full control of the affected server.



Commands are executed in the context of the System user for Cisco Secure ACS authentication service running on Microsoft Windows.



Cisco Secure ACS uses the standard RADIUS UDP port 1812 or 1645 for EAP-FAST authentication. 



This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCui57636["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui57636"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for the Cisco Secure ACS and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3466.
