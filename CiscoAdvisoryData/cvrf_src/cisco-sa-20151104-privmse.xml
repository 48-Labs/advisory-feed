    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the installation procedure of the Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE) appliance could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate to the root level.



The vulnerability is due to incorrect installation and permissions settings on binary files during the MSE physical or virtual appliance install procedure. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging into the device and escalating their privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to acquire root-level privileges and take full control of the device.


Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. 



This advisory is available at the following link: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151104-privmse["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151104-privmse"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE) versions 8.0.120.7 and earlier are vulnerable. Administrators can use a command to determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco MSE is running. Prior to 10.0, the command is getserverinfo. For 10.0 and later, the command is cmxctl version. The following examples show an MSE running versions 8.0.120.1 and 10.2.0:



[mse]# getserverinfo 

Health Monitor is running

    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">If authentication, accounting, and authorization (AAA) server logs indicate that an authenticated user is performing actions at a higher privilege level than their originally assigned role, it could indicate that the device has been compromised. In particular, the authenticated user can obtain root privilege; therefore, all commands executed at the root level should be monitored.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
