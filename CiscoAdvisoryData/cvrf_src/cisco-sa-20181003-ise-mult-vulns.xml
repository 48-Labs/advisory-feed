    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device with the privileges of the web server.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this security advisory.

There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Two vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device with the privileges of the web server.

The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.

Cisco Identity Services Engine File Upload Code Execution Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to a web-accessible folder on an affected system and perform arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is due to insecure restrictions when files are uploaded to the web-based management interface. An attacker who has valid administrator credentials on the system could exploit this vulnerability by uploading code to be executed on the underlying operating system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server, which runs with non-root privileges.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-15424

The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium


Cisco Identity Services Engine Java Deserialization Vulnerability
A vulnerability in Java deserialization in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected device with the privileges of the web server.

The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the web-based management interface. An attacker who has valid administrator credentials on the device could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted serialized Java object. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web server, which runs with non-root privileges.

The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-15425

The SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerability Policy" Type="General" Ordinal="7">To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html"]. This document also contains instructions for obtaining fixed software and receiving security vulnerability information from Cisco.</cvrf:Note>
