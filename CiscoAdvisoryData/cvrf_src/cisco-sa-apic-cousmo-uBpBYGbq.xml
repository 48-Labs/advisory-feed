    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the restricted security domain implementation of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify the behavior of default system policies, such as quality of service (QoS) policies, on an affected system.

This vulnerability is due to improper access control when restricted security domains are used to implement multi-tenancy. An attacker with a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete child policies created under default system policies, which are implicitly used by all tenants in the fabric, resulting in disruption of network traffic. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apic-cousmo-uBpBYGbq ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apic-cousmo-uBpBYGbq"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco APIC if restricted security domains were configured with associated users that have port-mgmt permissions.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
  Determine Restricted Security Domain Configuration and User Port-Mgmt Permissions
To determine whether restricted security domains are configured, run the moquery -c aaaDomain -f 'aaa.Domain.restrictedRbacDomain=="yes"' | egrep dn command at the device CLI, as shown in the following example:


apic1# moquery -c aaaDomain -f 'aaa.Domain.restrictedRbacDomain=="yes"' | egrep dn
dn     : uni/userext/domain-company1
dn     : uni/userext/domain-company2

To determine whether users have port-mgmt permissions, run the moquery -c aaaUserRole -f 'aaa.UserRole.name=="port-mgmt"' | egrep dn command at the device CLI, as shown in the following example:


apic1# moquery -c aaaUserRole -f 'aaa.UserRole.name=="port-mgmt"' | egrep dn
dn     : uni/userext/user-company1-admin/userdomain-all/role-port-mgmt
dn     : uni/userext/user-company2-admin/userdomain-all/role-port-mgmt

The configuration is affected by this vulnerability only if a user with port-mgmt permissions is associated with a restricted security domain. For the configuration to be affected by this vulnerability, entries must be returned by both the queries above.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Cloud Network Controller, formerly known as Cloud APIC.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Restricted security domains are used to provide multi-tenancy capabilities in policies and profiles outside the tenant level. Even if these policies and profiles do not belong to any tenant, by using separate restricted security domains for each tenant, users from each tenant can create policies and profiles that are hidden to users in other tenants.

For more information about restricting access using security domains, see the Cisco APIC Security Configuration Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/6x/security-configuration/cisco-apic-security-configuration-guide-60x/restricting-access-using-security-domains-and-node-rules-60x.html?cachemode=refresh"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
