    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) Player could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data about the application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.

The vulnerability is due to a design flaw in Cisco WRF Player. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by utilizing a maliciously crafted file that could bypass checks in the code and enable an attacker to read memory from outside the bounds of the mapped file.


There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
  This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180502-webex-id ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180502-webex-id"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings sites, and Cisco WebEx WRF players. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

To determine whether a Cisco WebEx Meetings site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx Meetings site and go to Support &gt; Downloads. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under About Meeting Center.

Alternatively, version information for the Cisco WebEx Meetings client can be accessed within the Cisco WebEx Meetings client. Version information for the Cisco WebEx Meetings client on Windows and Linux platforms can be viewed by choosing Help &gt; About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center. Version information for the Cisco WebEx Meetings client on Mac platforms can be viewed by choosing Meeting Center &gt; About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center.

The Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 30.32.16 is fixed, build 30.32.17 will contain updated software. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, for example, T30 SP32 EP 16, which shows that the server is running client build 30.32.16.

Note: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS) meeting services are a hosted multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx.

The WRF file format is used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site.

The Cisco WebEx WRF Player is an application that is used to play back and edit WebEx WRF recording files (files with .wrf extensions).

The Cisco WebEx WRF Player can be installed automatically when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a Cisco WebEx Meetings site (for stream playback mode). The Cisco WebEx WRF Player can also be installed manually after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html ["http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"] for offline playback of recording files.

The Cisco WebEx WRF Player is available for all Cisco WebEx Business Suite clients (WBS31 and WBS32) and Cisco WebEx Meetings clients.

The vulnerability described in this advisory could allow an attacker to bypass checks in the code and enable the attacker to read memory from outside the bounds of the mapped file.

To exploit this vulnerability, the player application would need to open a malicious WRF file. The vulnerability cannot be triggered by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, it is possible to remove all Cisco WebEx software completely from a system by using the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows) or Mac WebEx Meeting Application Uninstaller (for Apple Mac OS X), both of which are available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help for Cisco Spark, WebEx, and Jabber article at https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396 ["https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396"].

Removal of the Cisco WebEx software from a Linux or UNIX-based system can be accomplished by following the steps in the Cisco Collaboration Help for Cisco Spark, WebEx, and Jabber article at https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX28548 ["https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX28548"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</cvrf:Note>
