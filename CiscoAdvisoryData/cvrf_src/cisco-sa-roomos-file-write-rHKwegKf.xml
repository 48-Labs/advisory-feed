    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) and Cisco RoomOS could allow an attacker to elevate privileges, overwrite arbitrary files, or view sensitive data on an affected device.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-roomos-file-write-rHKwegKf ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-roomos-file-write-rHKwegKf"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected the following Cisco products:

TelePresence CE
RoomOS in on-premises operation
RoomOS in cloud-aware on-premises operation, which is cloud based

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2023-20090: Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

A vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper access control on certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a series of crafted commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID: CSCwc85883 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc85883"]
CVE ID: CVE-2023-20090
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.7
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2023-20091: Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Arbitrary File Overwrite Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local file system of an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files that are on the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have a remote support user account.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID: CSCwc71178 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc71178"]
CVE ID: CVE-2023-20091
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L

CVE-2023-20004, CVE-2023-20092, and CVE-2023-20093: Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Arbitrary File Overwrite Vulnerabilities

Three vulnerabilities in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local file system of an affected device.

These vulnerabilities are due to improper access controls on files that are on the local file system. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have a remote support user account.

Note: CVE-2023-20092 does not affect Cisco DX70, DX80, TelePresence MX Series, or TelePresence SX Series devices.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

CVE-2023-20094: Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Information Disclosure Vulnerability


A vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to view sensitive information on an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because the affected software performs improper bounds checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read that discloses sensitive information.

Note: This vulnerability only affects Cisco Webex Desk Hub.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID: CSCwb86296 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb86296"]
CVE ID: CVE-2023-20094
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 4.3
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
      Fixed Releases
At the time of publication, the release information in the following tables was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

The left column lists Cisco software releases. The center and right columns indicate whether a release was affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and which release included the fix for these vulnerabilities.

Note: For releases 9.15 and earlier, the software for on-premises devices was called TelePresence CE, and the software for cloud deployments was called RoomOS. For releases 10 and later, the software for both on-premises and cloud deployments is called RoomOS. Cloud deployments of RoomOS do not use standard release numbers. Instead, the name of the release includes the month in which the release was made available—for example, RoomOS March 2023.
