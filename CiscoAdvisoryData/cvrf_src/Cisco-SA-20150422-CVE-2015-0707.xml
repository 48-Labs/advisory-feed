    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center (MC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the user of the web interface.



The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of parameter values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into an affected parameter and then convincing the user to access a web page that would require reading or executing the parameter.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must have authenticated access to inject malicious code into a parameter in the affected application. This access requirement may decrease the likelihood of a successful exploit.



The attacker may provide a link that directs a targeted user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.



Cisco would like to thank Or Moran, Lior Neumann, Liad Mizrachi, and Oded Vanunu from Check Point Security Research Team for reporting this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
