    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the anti-spam scanner of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the anti-spam functionality of the ESA.



The vulnerability is due to improper error handling of a malformed packet in the anti-spam scanner. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS Sender Policy Framework (SPF) text record. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the anti-spam scanner and generate a malformed packet alert.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150612-esa["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150612-esa"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS versions through 9.6 for ESA, on both virtual and hardware appliances, that are configured to perform anti-spam scanning and SPF/Sender Identification Framework (SIDF) verification for mail flow.



To determine whether an ESA is configured to perform anti-spam scanning, use the GUI and navigate to Open Security services &gt; IronPort Anti-Spam, and verify that IronPort Anti-Spam is enabled. 



To determine whether SPF/SIDF is configured, use the GUI and navigate to Mail Polices &gt; Mail Flow Policies. For each configured policy name, scroll down to Security Services &gt; SPF/SIDF Verification and verify that SPF/SIDF verification is enabled.


To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco ESA, administrators can use the version command in the ESA CLI. The following example shows the results for a device running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:


ciscoesa&gt; version
Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance
Model: X1070
Version: 8.5.3-051
.

.




Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) includes the Cisco ESA and Cisco Security Management Appliance (SMA) as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following products are not vulnerable:


    Cisco Security Mail Appliance, both virtual and hardware versions
    Cisco Web Security Appliance, both virtual and hardware versions



No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The indicator of compromise for this vulnerability is that the ESA log file will show the following error when this problem is detected:


Critical  : MID ###### cannot be scanned by IMS. The message is either malformed or bad headers.

Warning: case antispam - engine (44476) : case-daemon: bdecode error: bad format: pos 921, ... 


To view the error logs, use the mail_logs command in the ESA CLI. The mail_logs log file contains the most recent system log messages.


esa&gt; mail_logs

esa&gt; grep "The message is either malformed or bad headers" mail_logs
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

In most cases an ESA can be updated over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the System Administration GUI. To upgrade a device by using the System Administration GUI:


    Choose System Administration &gt; System Upgrade.
    Click Upgrade Options.
    Choose the option to Download and Install or, for an ESA, Download the upgrade.
    Choose the release to upgrade to.
    In the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.
    Click Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.

After the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.
