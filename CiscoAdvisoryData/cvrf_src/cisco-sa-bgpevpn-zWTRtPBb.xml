  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

This vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a BGP update message that contains specific EVPN attributes. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must control a BGP speaker that has an established trusted peer connection to an affected device that is configured with the address family L2VPN EVPN to receive and process the update message. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by any data that is initiated by clients on the Layer 2 network or by peers that are not configured to accept the L2VPN EVPN address family. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.

The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP updates only from explicitly defined peers. For this vulnerability to be exploited, the malicious BGP update message must either come from a configured, valid BGP peer or be injected by the attacker into the affected BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is part of the April 2022 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: April 2022 Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74835"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco devices if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and had BGP configured with at least one peer that was configured with the address family L2VPN EVPN.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

Determine Whether the Device is Configured for BGP

To determine whether the device is configured for BGP, use the show running-config router bgp EXEC CLI command. If the router is configured for BGP, this command will return output, as shown in the following example:


# show running-config router bgp
router bgp 65536...

Determine Whether the Device has L2VPN EVPN Neighbors Configured

To determine whether the device has any neighbors that are configured for the L2VPN EVPN address family, use the show running-config router bgp AS-number EXEC CLI command. The following example shows the partial output of the show running-config router bgp AS-number command on a device that has the L2VPN EVPN address family configured:


# show running-config router bgp 65536
router bgp 65536address-family l2vpn evpn..
neighbor-group example
address-family l2vpn evpn.
