    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.



The vulnerabilities are due to improper input validation of certain parameters passed via HTTP GET or POST methods to an affected device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerabilities and has released updated software.




To exploit the vulnerabilities, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site or provide a crafted file intended to submit malicious input to the affected software to a user and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link or open the provided file.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco has released bug ID's CSCuq82322["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuq82322"], CSCut95853,["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCut95853"] and CSCuq73975["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuq73975"]  for registered users, which contain additional details and up-to-date lists of affected product versions.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">At the time this alert was first published, Cisco Finesse version 10.5(1) was vulnerable. Later releases of Cisco Finesse may also be vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



Administrators are advised to run both firewall and antivirus applications to minimize the potential of inbound and outbound threats.



Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.



Administrators can help protect affected systems from external attacks by using a solid firewall strategy.



Users are advised not to open email messages from suspicious or unrecognized sources. If users cannot verify that links or attachments included in email messages are safe, they are advised not to open them.



Users are advised not to open unsolicited email attachments.



Users are advised not to visit websites or follow links that have suspicious characteristics or cannot be verified as safe.
