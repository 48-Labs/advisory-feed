Determine the Cisco NX-OS BIOS Version

To determine which Cisco NX-OS BIOS version is running on a device, use the show version | include BIOS CLI command, as shown in the following example:


switch# show version | include BIOS
  BIOS: version 01.11
BIOS compile time:  06/30/2023

To determine both the primary BIOS and alternate BIOS versions that are installed on a device, use the show hardware internal dev-version | include BIOS CLI command. This command is not available on Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches in ACI mode. The alternate BIOS is used when the primary BIOS becomes corrupted. The following shows an example output:


switch#  show hardware internal dev-version | include BIOS
BIOS version                     v08.39(04/04/2021)
Alternate BIOS version           v08.39(04/04/2021)

      Fixed Releases
Resolution of this vulnerability requires a BIOS update on affected Cisco MDS, Nexus, and UCS Fabric Interconnect platforms that are running Cisco NX-OS Software.

To upgrade the BIOS on Cisco MDS and Cisco Nexus Standalone platforms, either upgrade Cisco NX-OS Software on the affected devices with the install all CLI command or install a release-independent BIOS upgrade script, as indicated in the Fixed Release table that follows. For more information, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide, Release 10.4(x) ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/nx-os/nexus9000/104x/upgrade/cisco-nexus-9000-series-nx-os-software-upgrade-and-downgrade-guide-104x/m-upgrading-or-downgrading-the-cisco-nexus-9000-series-nx-os-software.html"].

For Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in ACI mode, upgrade to a fixed software release as shown in the Fixed Release table that follows. For more information, see the Cisco APIC Installation and ACI Upgrade and Downgrade Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/all/apic-installation-aci-upgrade-downgrade/Cisco-APIC-Installation-ACI-Upgrade-Downgrade-Guide/m-managing-fpga-epld-bios-firmware.html"].

Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS mode

For Nexus 9000 Series switches in standalone NX-OS mode, the primary BIOS is upgraded automatically when upgrading to a fixed software release using the install all CLI command. To also upgrade the alternate BIOS, use the install module module# bios golden CLI command after the upgrade to a software release that includes the fixed BIOS is completed. For modular devices, replace the module# variable with the Supervisor Module number, which is found in the output of the show module CLI command. For fixed form factor devices, the command will be install module 1 bios golden.

Alternatively, if the BIOS upgrade script is used to upgrade the BIOS, the primary and alternate BIOS are both upgraded as part of the process. The BIOS upgrade script is release-independent and PID-independent and is available from the Cisco Software Download Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286331348/type/286280105/release/10.4(4)"]. For installation steps, see the associated README ["https://www.cisco.com/web/software/283724313/164521/readme_CSCwm47438.txt"] file.
