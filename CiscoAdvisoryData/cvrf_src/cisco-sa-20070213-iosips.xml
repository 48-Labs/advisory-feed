    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco IOS Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is an inline, deep-packet  inspection-based feature that enables Cisco IOS software to mitigate network  attacks. Cisco IOS IPS enables the network to defend itself with the  intelligence to identify, classify, and stop or block certain malicious or  damaging traffic in real time. The IOS IPS feature set contains multiple  vulnerabilities. Only IOS images containing the IPS feature set are affected by  these vulnerabilities.
    Fragmented Packet Evasion Vulnerability
Some of the IPS signatures utilize regular expressions. Due to a  vulnerability, an attacker can evade those IPS signatures by sending malicious  network traffic as IP fragments. This may result in potential malicious traffic  bypassing signature inspection and possibly allow the exploitation of protected  systems. IPS signatures which do not utilize regular expressions are not  affected by this vulnerability. All IP protocols (e.g. TCP, UDP, ICMP) are  affected by this vulnerability. There is a mitigation for this vulnerability.  This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID   CSCsg15598  ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsg15598"]            ( registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only)         .
    ATOMIC.TCP Regular Expression Denial of Service Vulnerability
Certain network traffic can trigger IPS signatures which use the  regular expression feature of the ATOMIC.TCP signature engine which may cause  the IOS IPS device to crash. This may cause a denial of service resulting in  disruption network traffic. Signature 3123.0 (Netbus Pro Traffic) has been  demonstrated to trigger this vulnerability. There is a workaround for this  vulnerability. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID    CSCsa53334  ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/ CSCsa53334"]            ( registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only)         .
    Vulnerability Scoring Details
Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory  based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

Cisco will provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then  compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the  vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are  encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the environmental  impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability  severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS  at  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html"].

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the  environmental impact for individual networks at  https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x"].

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">The effectiveness of any mitigation or fix is dependent on specific  customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior,  and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and  releases, customers should consult with their service provider or support  organization to ensure any applied mitigation or fix is the most appropriate  for use in the intended network before it is deployed.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the  network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for  this advisory:  https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20070213-iosips ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20070213-iosips"]
      Fragmented Packet Evasion Vulnerability
There is a mitigation for the fragmented packet evasion vulnerability.  The fragments keyword of IOS transit Access Control Lists  (ACL) can be used to prohibit fragmented IP packets from transiting an IOS  device. More information about filtering IP fragments can be found here:

   http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml#frag ["/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml#frag"]


Blocking IP fragments may have adverse affects on some protocols (like  HTTP, FTP and Kerberos/Active Directory), so this workaround should be used  with caution.


access-list 100 deny tcp any 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 fragments
access-list 100 deny udp any 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 fragments
     ATOMIC.TCP Regular Expression Denial of Service Vulnerability
There is a workaround for the ATOMIC.TCP regular expression denial of  service vulnerability by deleting IPS signature 3123.0 from the IOS IPS  Signature Definition File (SDF). Disabling signature 3123.0 is alone not  sufficient for the workaround to be effective. The following commands will  delete signature 3123.0 from an IOS IPS device.


router#configure terminal
router(config)#ip ips signature 3123 delete %IPS Signature 3123:0 is marked for deletion %IPS The signature will be deleted when signatures are reloaded or saved router(config)#interface FastEthernet0/0 router(config)#no ip ips test in      router(config)#ip ips test in router(config)#exit

In the above example, signature 3123.0 is first deleted from the  Signature Definition File, then the IPS instance running on interface  FastEthernet0/0 is stopped and started to reinitialize the IPS state to reflect  the signature deletion. If the IPS feature set is configured on multiple  interfaces, then these steps must be completed for each affected interface.

To determine if signature 3123 is active, use the show ip  ips signature command.


router#show ip ips signatures | include 3123
3123:0      N   A      MED     0      0     0   100    30 FA  N    S46

In the command output above, the N after 3123.0  indicates that the signature is present in the configuration but not enabled.  Once the signature has been deleted, rerunning the show ip ips  signature command shows:


router#show ip ips signatures | include 3123
3123:0      N*   A      MED     0      0     0   100    30 FA  N    S46

In the command output above, the N* after 3123.0  indicates that the signature has been deleted from the configuration. The IPS  feature set must be restarted on each interface configured for IPS to complete  the workaround. Once completed, the output of the show ip ips  signature command will show:


router#show ip ips signatures | include 3123
 router#

This vulnerability may affect any IPS signature using the regular  expression functionality of the ATOMIC.TCP engine. Currently, Cisco only ships  one signature configured this way (3123.0). If custom signatures have been  added to an IOS IPS device configured use the ATOMIC.TCP engine with a regular  expression, these signatures must also be deleted from the IPS configuration to  ensure the effectiveness of the workaround.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, also consult  http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"]  and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade  solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the  devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and  software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new  release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical  Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted maintenance provider for  assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) describes a release  train and the platforms or products for which it is intended. If a given  release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible releases that contain  the fix (the "First Fixed Release") and the anticipated date of availability  for each are listed in the "Rebuild" and "Maintenance" columns. A device  running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release in a  specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable.  The release should be upgraded at least to the indicated release or a later  version (greater than or equal to the First Fixed Release label).

     ATOMIC.TCP Regular Expression Denial of Service Vulnerability
There is a workaround for the ATOMIC.TCP regular expression denial of  service vulnerability by deleting IPS signature 3123.0 from the IOS IPS  Signature Definition File (SDF). Disabling signature 3123.0 is alone not  sufficient for the workaround to be effective. The following commands will  delete signature 3123.0 from an IOS IPS device.

In the command output above, the N after 3123.0  indicates that the signature is present in the configuration but not enabled.  Once the signature has been deleted, rerunning the show ip ips  signature command shows:


router#show ip ips signatures | include 3123
3123:0      N*   A      MED     0      0     0   100    30 FA  N    S46

In the command output above, the N* after 3123.0  indicates that the signature has been deleted from the configuration. The IPS  feature set must be restarted on each interface configured for IPS to complete  the workaround. Once completed, the output of the show ip ips  signature command will show:

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the  network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for  this advisory:  https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20070213-iosips ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20070213-iosips"]
      Fragmented Packet Evasion Vulnerability
There is a mitigation for the fragmented packet evasion vulnerability.  The fragments keyword of IOS transit Access Control Lists  (ACL) can be used to prohibit fragmented IP packets from transiting an IOS  device. More information about filtering IP fragments can be found here:

   http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml#frag ["/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml#frag"]


Blocking IP fragments may have adverse affects on some protocols (like  HTTP, FTP and Kerberos/Active Directory), so this workaround should be used  with caution.


access-list 100 deny tcp any 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 fragments
access-list 100 deny udp any 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 fragments
     ATOMIC.TCP Regular Expression Denial of Service Vulnerability
There is a workaround for the ATOMIC.TCP regular expression denial of  service vulnerability by deleting IPS signature 3123.0 from the IOS IPS  Signature Definition File (SDF). Disabling signature 3123.0 is alone not  sufficient for the workaround to be effective. The following commands will  delete signature 3123.0 from an IOS IPS device.


router#configure terminal
router(config)#ip ips signature 3123 delete %IPS Signature 3123:0 is marked for deletion %IPS The signature will be deleted when signatures are reloaded or saved router(config)#interface FastEthernet0/0 router(config)#no ip ips test in      router(config)#ip ips test in router(config)#exit

In the above example, signature 3123.0 is first deleted from the  Signature Definition File, then the IPS instance running on interface  FastEthernet0/0 is stopped and started to reinitialize the IPS state to reflect  the signature deletion. If the IPS feature set is configured on multiple  interfaces, then these steps must be completed for each affected interface.

To determine if signature 3123 is active, use the show ip  ips signature command.


router#show ip ips signatures | include 3123
3123:0      N   A      MED     0      0     0   100    30 FA  N    S46

In the command output above, the N after 3123.0  indicates that the signature is present in the configuration but not enabled.  Once the signature has been deleted, rerunning the show ip ips  signature command shows:


router#show ip ips signatures | include 3123
3123:0      N*   A      MED     0      0     0   100    30 FA  N    S46

In the command output above, the N* after 3123.0  indicates that the signature has been deleted from the configuration. The IPS  feature set must be restarted on each interface configured for IPS to complete  the workaround. Once completed, the output of the show ip ips  signature command will show:


router#show ip ips signatures | include 3123
 router#

This vulnerability may affect any IPS signature using the regular  expression functionality of the ATOMIC.TCP engine. Currently, Cisco only ships  one signature configured this way (3123.0). If custom signatures have been  added to an IOS IPS device configured use the ATOMIC.TCP engine with a regular  expression, these signatures must also be deleted from the IPS configuration to  ensure the effectiveness of the workaround.</Description>
