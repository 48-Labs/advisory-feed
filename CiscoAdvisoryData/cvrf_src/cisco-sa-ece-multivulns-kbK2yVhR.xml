    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, enumerate existing user accounts, and redirect a user to an undesired webpage.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco ECE.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2022-20631: Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ECE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.

The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious script code in a chat window. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvz20427 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz20427"], CSCvz50637 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz50637"]
CVE ID: CVE-2022-20631
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2022-20632: Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ECE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.

The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvz20436 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz20436"]
CVE ID: CVE-2022-20632
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2022-20633: Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email Username Enumeration Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ECE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a username enumeration attack against an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to differences in authentication responses that are sent back from the application as part of an authentication attempt. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending authentication requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to confirm existing user accounts, which could be used in further attacks.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvz20450 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz20450"]
CVE ID: CVE-2022-20633
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 5.3
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2022-20634: Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email Open Redirect Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ECE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to an undesired web page.

This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the URL parameters in an HTTP request that is sent to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the interface to redirect the user to a specific, malicious URL. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
