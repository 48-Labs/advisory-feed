    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified IP Phone 9900 Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate and have local access to the targeted device. These requirements would likely decrease the possibility of a successful exploit.
