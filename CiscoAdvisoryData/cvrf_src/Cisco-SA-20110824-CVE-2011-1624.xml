  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of login banners by Cisco IOS Software.  An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in via SSH using two sessions.  If successful, the attacker could cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco confirmed the vulnerability in software release notes and released updated software.





To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able to log in via SSH to a targeted device.  The access requirement restricts the source of exploits to current users of an affected system.  Exploits may happen accidentally when a legitimate user attempts to log in using two SSH sessions.
