    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the multicast traceroute version 2 (Mtrace2) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust the UDP packet memory of an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because the Mtrace2 code does not properly handle packet memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the incoming UDP packet memory. The affected device would not be able to process higher-level UDP-based protocols packets, possibly causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Note: This vulnerability can be exploited using IPv4 or IPv6.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-pak-mem-exhst-3ke9FeFy ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-pak-mem-exhst-3ke9FeFy"]

This advisory is part of the September 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75416"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and are processing Mtrace2 packets.

Cisco IOS XR Software releases earlier than Release 7.7.1 are not affected.

Cisco IOS XR Software releases 7.7.1 through 7.11.2 are affected if the multicast RPM Packet Manager (RPM) is installed and active on the device, regardless of any multicast configuration.

Cisco IOS XR Software releases 24.1.1 and later are affected if the multicast RPM is installed and active and the device has a multicast configuration. If multicast is not configured, the device is not vulnerable.

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.

Determine Whether the Multicast RPM is Active

To determine whether the multicast RPM is active, use the show install active summary | include mcast command. If that command returns an empty output, the multicast RPM is not active.

Determine Whether Mtrace2 Processing is Enabled

To determine whether the device is processing Mtrace2 packets, use the show lpts pifib hardware entry brief location &lt;LC&gt; | include 33433 command and the show lpts pifib entry brief | include 33433 command to see if LPTS entries are created for the Mtrace2 port. If both commands return empty output, the device is not processing Mtrace2 packets.

In the following examples, the device does create LPTS entries and will process Mtrace2 packets:
        RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Router#show lpts pifib hardware entry brief location 0/0/CPU0 | include 33433      IPV4 any  any  any  0  17  33433  0  0  UDP-listen  Dlvr RP0  LOW  0  0  0-default      IPV4 any  any  any  0  17  33433  0  1   UDP-listen  Dlvr RP0  LOW  0  0  0-default      IPV4 any  any  any  0  17  33433  0  2   UDP-listen  Dlvr RP0  LOW  0  0  0-default      IPV4 any  any  any  0  17  33433  0  0  UDP-listen  Dlvr RP0  LOW  0  0  0-default      IPV4 any  any  any  0  17  33433  0  1   UDP-listen  Dlvr RP0  LOW  0  0  0-default      IPV4 any  any  any  0  17  33433  0  2  UDP-listen  Dlvr RP0  LOW  0  0  0-default      RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Router#
  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Router# show lpts pifib entry brief | include 33433
  IPv4       default  UDP    any          0/RP0/CPU0                   any,33433 any    IPv6       default  UDP    any          0/RP0/CPU0                   any,33433 any

Note: Mtrace2 on Cisco IOS XR Software uses the non-standard port 33433 instead of the standard RFC port of 33435.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

IOS Software
IOS XE Software
NX-OS Software</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The show packet memory command can be used to verify the number of packets that are currently held in the packet memory, as shown in the following example:


RP/0/RP0/CPU0:#show packet-memory summary
 ProcId JobId Count Percentage Process
4916   328     9      0.18% tcp
4512  1241  1125     22.46% igmp
4527  1246  3875     77.36% mld

During normal operations, the packet count should be low. If the packet count for the mld process or the igmp process steadily increases or never decreases over several runs of that command, the device is affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there are mitigations for this vulnerability.

Deactivate the RPM on Cisco IOS XR Releases 7.7 to 7.11

If the device does not need the multicast configuration, deactivate and remove the multicast RPM. This will close the vulnerable UDP port.

In this example, the multicast package asr9k-mcast-x64-2.0.0.0-r7921.x86_64.rpm is deactivated:


Router# show install active summary | include mcast

asr9k-mcast-x64-2.0.0.0-r7921.x86_64.rpm

Router# install deactivate asr9k-mcast-x64-2.0.0.0-r7921.x86_64.rpm synchronous

Router# install commit

Use an Infrastructure Access Control List (iACLs) to Block Port 33433

To protect infrastructure devices and minimize the risk, impact, and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks, administrators are advised to deploy iACLs to enforce policies on traffic that is sent to infrastructure equipment. Administrators can construct an iACL by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic that is sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations. For the maximum protection of infrastructure devices, deployed iACLs should be applied in the ingress direction on all interfaces to which an IP address has been configured. An iACL mitigation cannot completely protect against this vulnerability when the attack originates from a trusted source address.

The iACL policy denies unauthorized Mtrace2 communications packets that are sent to UDP port 33433 on affected devices. In the following example, 192.168.60.0/24 is the IP address space that is used by the affected devices. Care should be taken to allow required traffic for routing and administrative access before denying all unauthorized traffic. Whenever possible, infrastructure address space should be distinct from the address space for user and services segments. Using this addressing methodology will assist with the construction and deployment of iACLs.

Note: Mtrace2 also supports IPv6, so a corresponding IPv6 iACL is required if the device has IPv6 configured.

Note: Cisco uses UDP port 33433, not 33435, for Mtrace2.

Restart IGMP and MLD Processes

Restarting the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) process or the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) process, or both processes, before the device runs out of memory can ensure that other processes will not be affected. (See the Details section for more information.) Restarting these processes does not prevent the device from leaking UDP memory.

Use the process restart mld or process restart igmp command to restart the respective processes.

While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
