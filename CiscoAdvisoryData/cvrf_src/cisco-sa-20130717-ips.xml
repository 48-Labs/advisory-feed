    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco IPS Software Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability



The Cisco IPS is a family of network security devices that provide network-based threat prevention services. Cisco IPS Software includes several applications that are used by the system to run different tasks. In particular, the MainApp process is responsible for multiple critical tasks including reading the configuration, starting and stopping applications and authentication service.



Additional information about the MainApp process is in the "System Architecture" section of the product configuration guide:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/ips/7.1/configuration/guide/idm/idm_system_architecture.html#wp1126061["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/ips/7.1/configuration/guide/idm/idm_system_architecture.html#wp1126061"]



A vulnerability in the IP stack could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the MainApp process to become unresponsive. This creates a denial of service (DoS) condition because the Cisco IPS sensor is not able to execute several critical tasks including alert notification, event store management, and sensor authentication. The Cisco IPS web server will also be unavailable while the MainApp process is unresponsive. Additionally, due to this general system failure, other processes such as the Analysis Engine may not work properly. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of malformed IP packets from the management interface of the affected system. An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IP packets to the management interface.



The vulnerability can be triggered only by IPv4 traffic directed to the management interface. Traffic passing through the sensing interfaces will not trigger this vulnerability. If the Cisco IPS is configured in promiscuous mode, mitigation actions that require MainApp processing such as shun or rate-limit may be unavailable. If the Cisco IPS is configured in inline mode, the sensor may not correctly perform inspection and mitigation actions because the Analysis Engine process may not be working properly.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtx18596["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx18596"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1243.



Cisco IPS Software Fragmented Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability



Cisco IPS SSP is an integrated module running on Cisco ASA 5500-X Series. The module could be deployed in hardware for the Cisco ASA 5585-X, or as an integrated software module for the Cisco ASA 5512-X, Cisco ASA 5515-X, Cisco ASA 5525-X, Cisco ASA 5545-X, and Cisco ASA 5555-X Series.



Cisco IPS Software running on the ASA 5500-X IPS SSP processes only traffic that it receives from the Cisco ASA. Cisco ASA needs to be configured with Modular Policy Framework (MPF) to redirect specific traffic to the Cisco IPS Software.



A vulnerability in the implementation of the code that processes fragmented traffic could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process to become unresponsive or cause the affected system to reload.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of fragmented IP packets sent from the Cisco ASA data plane to the Cisco IPS processor for inspection and processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a combination of fragmented and other IP packets through the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or cause the Analysis Engine process to become unresponsive. When the Analysis Engine process is unresponsive, the affected system will not process traffic, which will cause that traffic to be dropped. Additionally, if the Cisco ASA with a Cisco IPS SSP software module running an
affected version of software is configured in High-Availability mode (HA), a failover event may be triggered when the Cisco IPS SSP reloads or stops forwarding traffic.



The vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 fragmented packets passing through the affected system. Traffic directed to the management IP address of the Cisco IPS software module will not trigger this vulnerability.



Note: This vulnerability affects only the Cisco ASA 5500-X Series IPS SSP software module. Cisco IPS SSP hardware modules supported on the Cisco ASA5585-X Series are not affected by this vulnerability.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue51272["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue51272"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1218.



Cisco IPS NME Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the memory allocation code could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of memory allocation when malformed IP packets are received on the management interface of the affected system. An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IP packets to the management IP address.



The vulnerability can be triggered only by IPv4 traffic directed to the management interface. Traffic passing through the sensing interfaces will not trigger this vulnerability.



This vulnerability affects only Cisco IPS Software running on Cisco IPS NME.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCua61977["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua61977"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3410.



Cisco IDSM-2 Malformed TCP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the IDSM-2 drivers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the system kernel to become unresponsive. This creates a denial of service (DoS) condition because the Cisco IPS sensor is not able to execute several critical tasks, including alert notification, event store management, sensor authentication, and traffic inspection. The Cisco IPS web server will also be unavailable.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of malformed TCP packets from the management interface of the affected system. An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IP packets to the management interface. A TCP three-way handshake is not required to exploit this vulnerability. A hard system reboot is needed to restore the functionality of the system.



The vulnerability can be triggered only by IPv4 traffic directed to the management interface. Traffic passing through the sensing interfaces will not trigger this vulnerability.



This vulnerability affects only Cisco IPS Software running on Cisco IDSM-2 Module.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh27460["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh27460"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3411.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco IPS Software Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability and Cisco IPS NME Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability



There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.



Cisco IPS Software Fragmented Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability



If an exploit of this vulnerability is causing traffic interruption, administrators can remove the Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the Cisco ASA that is used to direct the user traffic toward the Cisco IPS SSP. This change will cause all user traffic to bypass Cisco IPS SSP module inspection and allow it to pass through the Cisco ASA.



The following example shows how to disable the redirecting of web traffic to the Cisco IPS Software module from the Cisco ASA firewall:

ASA(config)# class-map ips_traffic
ASA(config-cmap)# match any
ASA(config)# policy-map ips_traffic_policy
ASA(config-pmap)# class ips_traffic
ASA(config-pmap-c)# no ips inline|promiscious

Note: Configuring IPS bypass with the command fail-open or fail-close will not have any effect on the Cisco IPS software module for the Cisco ASA.



If the IPS is running in promiscuous mode, as a mitigation, fragmented traffic can be disabled for IPS processing.



The following example shows how to disable fragmented traffic on the Cisco IPS software module:

sensor# conf t
sensor(config)# ser sig sig0
sensor(config-sig)# sig 1200 0
sensor(config-sig-sig)# engine normalizer 
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor)# edit-default-sigs-only default-signatures-only 
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def)# specify-max-fragments yes
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def-yes)# max-fragments 0
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def-yes)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig)# exit
sensor(config-sig)# exit
Apply Changes?[yes]: yes

This change requires a Cisco IPS software module reload.



Note: This change will cause all non-TCP fragments to pass uninspected.



Alternatively, fragmented traffic can be disallowed on the Cisco ASA firewall. This will cause the Cisco ASA firewall not to accept any fragments on its interfaces. Consequently, the Cisco ASA will not send any fragments to the Cisco IPS software module for inspection.



The following example shows how to disable fragmented traffic on the Cisco ASA firewall:

ASA(config)# fragment chain 1 

Note: The preceding example will disable fragments on all the Cisco ASA interfaces.



Cisco IDSM-2 Malformed TCP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability



There is no workaround for this vulnerability however, the Cisco IDSM-2 Module administrator should make sure to limit the number of hosts (IP addresses) allowed to connect to the management interface of system.



To restrict the number of allowed hosts, the administrator should use the access-list command. The no access-list command should be used to remove any hosts or networks from the list.

The following example shows the sequence of commands to remove the access to the full 192.168.1.0/24 network and allow access only to the host with IP address 192.168.1.1:

    Use the show settings command in network-setting configuration mode to see the current allowed hosts or networks. The following example shows that the Cisco IDSM-2 is configured to allow all the hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network


sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings
   network-settings
   -----------------------------------------------
      [...]
      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)
      -----------------------------------------------
         network-address: 192.168.1.0/24
         -----------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------
      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds 
      login-banner-text: 
      [...]


    Use the access-list command in network-setting configuration mode, to add the 192.168.1.1 hosts. Make sure that if this is the only allowed host, it is also the one from which you are executing the configuration to avoid losing connectivity to the Cisco IDSM-2 Module.


sensor(config-hos-net)#access-list 192.168.1.1/32


    Use the no access-list command in network-setting configuration mode, to remove the 192.168.1.0/32 network for the allowed hosts list.


sensor(config-hos-net)#no access-list 192.168.1.0/24


    Use the show setting command in network-setting configuration mode to check that the list of allowed hosts is correct:


sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings
   network-settings
   -----------------------------------------------
      [...]
      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)
      -----------------------------------------------
         network-address: 192.168.1.1/32
         -----------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------
      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds 
      login-banner-text: 
      [...]


    Exit and apply the configuration:


sensor(config-hos-net)# exit
sensor(config-hos)# exit
Apply Changes:?[yes]: 

Note: Internal tests performed by Cisco have shown that this vulnerability cannot be exploited if the total number of hosts allowed is less than or equal to 254 hosts. Administrators who cannot reduce the number of allowed hosts to the number indicated in this advisory should contact Cisco Technical Assistance Center for additional support.

        <Description>Cisco IPS Software Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability and Cisco IPS NME Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability



There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.



Cisco IPS Software Fragmented Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability



If an exploit of this vulnerability is causing traffic interruption, administrators can remove the Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the Cisco ASA that is used to direct the user traffic toward the Cisco IPS SSP. This change will cause all user traffic to bypass Cisco IPS SSP module inspection and allow it to pass through the Cisco ASA.



The following example shows how to disable the redirecting of web traffic to the Cisco IPS Software module from the Cisco ASA firewall:

ASA(config)# class-map ips_traffic
ASA(config-cmap)# match any
ASA(config)# policy-map ips_traffic_policy
ASA(config-pmap)# class ips_traffic
ASA(config-pmap-c)# no ips inline|promiscious

Note: Configuring IPS bypass with the command fail-open or fail-close will not have any effect on the Cisco IPS software module for the Cisco ASA.



If the IPS is running in promiscuous mode, as a mitigation, fragmented traffic can be disabled for IPS processing.



The following example shows how to disable fragmented traffic on the Cisco IPS software module:

sensor# conf t
sensor(config)# ser sig sig0
sensor(config-sig)# sig 1200 0
sensor(config-sig-sig)# engine normalizer 
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor)# edit-default-sigs-only default-signatures-only 
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def)# specify-max-fragments yes
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def-yes)# max-fragments 0
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def-yes)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig)# exit
sensor(config-sig)# exit
Apply Changes?[yes]: yes

This change requires a Cisco IPS software module reload.



Note: This change will cause all non-TCP fragments to pass uninspected.



Alternatively, fragmented traffic can be disallowed on the Cisco ASA firewall. This will cause the Cisco ASA firewall not to accept any fragments on its interfaces. Consequently, the Cisco ASA will not send any fragments to the Cisco IPS software module for inspection.



The following example shows how to disable fragmented traffic on the Cisco ASA firewall:

ASA(config)# fragment chain 1 

Note: The preceding example will disable fragments on all the Cisco ASA interfaces.



Cisco IDSM-2 Malformed TCP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability



There is no workaround for this vulnerability however, the Cisco IDSM-2 Module administrator should make sure to limit the number of hosts (IP addresses) allowed to connect to the management interface of system.



To restrict the number of allowed hosts, the administrator should use the access-list command. The no access-list command should be used to remove any hosts or networks from the list.

The following example shows the sequence of commands to remove the access to the full 192.168.1.0/24 network and allow access only to the host with IP address 192.168.1.1:

    Use the show settings command in network-setting configuration mode to see the current allowed hosts or networks. The following example shows that the Cisco IDSM-2 is configured to allow all the hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network


sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings
   network-settings
   -----------------------------------------------
      [...]
      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)
      -----------------------------------------------
         network-address: 192.168.1.0/24
         -----------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------
      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds 
      login-banner-text: 
      [...]


    Use the access-list command in network-setting configuration mode, to add the 192.168.1.1 hosts. Make sure that if this is the only allowed host, it is also the one from which you are executing the configuration to avoid losing connectivity to the Cisco IDSM-2 Module.


sensor(config-hos-net)#access-list 192.168.1.1/32


    Use the no access-list command in network-setting configuration mode, to remove the 192.168.1.0/32 network for the allowed hosts list.


sensor(config-hos-net)#no access-list 192.168.1.0/24


    Use the show setting command in network-setting configuration mode to check that the list of allowed hosts is correct:


sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings
   network-settings
   -----------------------------------------------
      [...]
      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)
      -----------------------------------------------
         network-address: 192.168.1.1/32
         -----------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------
      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds 
      login-banner-text: 
      [...]


    Exit and apply the configuration:


sensor(config-hos-net)# exit
sensor(config-hos)# exit
Apply Changes:?[yes]: 

Note: Internal tests performed by Cisco have shown that this vulnerability cannot be exploited if the total number of hosts allowed is less than or equal to 254 hosts. Administrators who cannot reduce the number of allowed hosts to the number indicated in this advisory should contact Cisco Technical Assistance Center for additional support.

ASA(config)# class-map ips_traffic
ASA(config-cmap)# match any
ASA(config)# policy-map ips_traffic_policy
ASA(config-pmap)# class ips_traffic
ASA(config-pmap-c)# no ips inline|promiscious

Note: Configuring IPS bypass with the command fail-open or fail-close will not have any effect on the Cisco IPS software module for the Cisco ASA.



If the IPS is running in promiscuous mode, as a mitigation, fragmented traffic can be disabled for IPS processing.



The following example shows how to disable fragmented traffic on the Cisco IPS software module:

sensor# conf t
sensor(config)# ser sig sig0
sensor(config-sig)# sig 1200 0
sensor(config-sig-sig)# engine normalizer 
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor)# edit-default-sigs-only default-signatures-only 
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def)# specify-max-fragments yes
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def-yes)# max-fragments 0
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def-yes)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor-def)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig-nor)# exit
sensor(config-sig-sig)# exit
sensor(config-sig)# exit
Apply Changes?[yes]: yes

This change requires a Cisco IPS software module reload.



Note: This change will cause all non-TCP fragments to pass uninspected.



Alternatively, fragmented traffic can be disallowed on the Cisco ASA firewall. This will cause the Cisco ASA firewall not to accept any fragments on its interfaces. Consequently, the Cisco ASA will not send any fragments to the Cisco IPS software module for inspection.



The following example shows how to disable fragmented traffic on the Cisco ASA firewall:

ASA(config)# fragment chain 1 

Note: The preceding example will disable fragments on all the Cisco ASA interfaces.



Cisco IDSM-2 Malformed TCP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability



There is no workaround for this vulnerability however, the Cisco IDSM-2 Module administrator should make sure to limit the number of hosts (IP addresses) allowed to connect to the management interface of system.



To restrict the number of allowed hosts, the administrator should use the access-list command. The no access-list command should be used to remove any hosts or networks from the list.

The following example shows the sequence of commands to remove the access to the full 192.168.1.0/24 network and allow access only to the host with IP address 192.168.1.1:

    Use the show settings command in network-setting configuration mode to see the current allowed hosts or networks. The following example shows that the Cisco IDSM-2 is configured to allow all the hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network


sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings
   network-settings
   -----------------------------------------------
      [...]
      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)
      -----------------------------------------------
         network-address: 192.168.1.0/24
         -----------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------
      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds 
      login-banner-text: 
      [...]


    Use the access-list command in network-setting configuration mode, to add the 192.168.1.1 hosts. Make sure that if this is the only allowed host, it is also the one from which you are executing the configuration to avoid losing connectivity to the Cisco IDSM-2 Module.


sensor(config-hos-net)#access-list 192.168.1.1/32


    Use the no access-list command in network-setting configuration mode, to remove the 192.168.1.0/32 network for the allowed hosts list.


sensor(config-hos-net)#no access-list 192.168.1.0/24


    Use the show setting command in network-setting configuration mode to check that the list of allowed hosts is correct:


sensor(config-hos-net)# show settings
   network-settings
   -----------------------------------------------
      [...]
      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)
      -----------------------------------------------
         network-address: 192.168.1.1/32
         -----------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------
      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds 
      login-banner-text: 
      [...]


    Exit and apply the configuration:


sensor(config-hos-net)# exit
sensor(config-hos)# exit
Apply Changes:?[yes]: 

Note: Internal tests performed by Cisco have shown that this vulnerability cannot be exploited if the total number of hosts allowed is less than or equal to 254 hosts. Administrators who cannot reduce the number of allowed hosts to the number indicated in this advisory should contact Cisco Technical Assistance Center for additional support.
