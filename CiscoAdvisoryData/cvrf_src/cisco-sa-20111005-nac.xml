    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">
Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC) Manager contains a directory
traversal vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain
system information. 

 There are no workarounds to mitigate this
vulnerability.

 Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 


This advisory is posted at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111005-nac["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111005-nac"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Only Cisco NAC Manager software versions 4.8.X are affected by this
vulnerability. Cisco NAC Manager software versions 4.7.X and earlier are not
affected.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The Cisco NAC Server (Appliance) is not affected. The Cisco Identity
Services Engine (ISE) is not affected. No other Cisco products are currently
known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">
The Cisco NAC (formerly Cisco Clean Access) solution allows network
administrators to authenticate, authorize, evaluate, and remediate wired,
wireless, and remote users and their machines prior to allowing users onto the
network. The solution identifies whether machines are compliant with security
policies and repairs vulnerabilities before permitting access to the network.
You can use the NAC Manager server and its web-based administration console to
manage multiple NAC Appliances in a deployment.

Cisco NAC Manager contains a directory traversal vulnerability. The
management interface uses TCP port 443. An unauthenticated attacker could
exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information, including password
files and system logs, that could be leveraged to launch subsequent attacks.
