For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that CVE-2025-20184 does not affect Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:
  CVE-2024-20184: Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Web Appliance Command Injection Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection attacks against an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of XML configuration files by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML configuration file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject commands to the underlying operating system with root privileges.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwk70559 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk70559"], CSCwk70576 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk70576"], CSCwk98506 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk98506"]
CVE ID: CVE-2024-20184
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
    CVE-2024-20185: Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, Cisco Secure Email Gateway, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the implementation of the remote access functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, Cisco Secure Email Gateway, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.

This vulnerability is due to an architectural flaw in the password generation algorithm for the remote access functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a temporary password for the service account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root and access the underlying operating system.

Note: The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is Medium due to the unrestricted scope of information that is accessible to an attacker.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwk70590 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk70590"], CSCwk70547 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk70547"], CSCwk70574 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk70574"]
CVE ID: CVE-2024-20185
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 3.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
