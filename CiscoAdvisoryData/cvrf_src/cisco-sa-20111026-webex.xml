    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">
Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) player. In some cases, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of a targeted user.

The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. The players can also be manually installed for offline playback after downloading the application from www.webex.com["http://www.webex.com"].

If the WRF player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the WRF player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from www.webex.com["http://www.webex.com"].

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.


This advisory is posted at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111026-webex["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111026-webex"].



Note: Effective October 18, 2011, Cisco moved the current list of Cisco Security Advisories and Responses published by Cisco PSIRT. The new location is https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing"]. You can also navigate to this page from the Cisco Products and Services menu of the Cisco Security (SIO) Portal. Following this transition, new Cisco Security Advisories and Responses will be published to the new location. Although the URL has changed, the content of security documents and the vulnerability policy are not impacted. Cisco will continue to disclose security vulnerabilities in accordance with the published Security Vulnerability Policy["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">
The vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WRF players. The Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the players are all affected. Review the following table for the list of releases that contain the nonvulnerable code. Affected versions of the players are those prior to client build T26 SP49 EP40 and T27 SP28. These build numbers are available only to WebEx site administrators. End users will see a version such as "Client build: 27.25.4.11889." This indicates the server is running software version T27 SP25 EP4.

To determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support &gt; Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under "About Support Center." See "Software Versions and Fixes" for details.

Cisco recommends that users upgrade to the most current version of the player that is available from www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html["http://www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html"]. If the player is no longer needed, it can be removed using the "Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller" or "Meeting Services Removal tool" available at support.webex.com/support/downloads.html["http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html"].

Users can manually verify the installed version of the WRF player to determine whether it is affected by these vulnerabilities. To do so, an administrator must examine the version numbers of the installed files and determine whether the version of the file contains the fixed code. Detailed instructions on how to verify the version numbers are provided in the following sections. 

The following tables provide the first nonvulnerable version of each object.
Microsoft Windows


Two dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) were updated on the Microsoft Windows platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. These files are in the folder C:\Program Files\WebEx\Record Playback or C:\Program Files (x86)\Webex\Record Player. The version number of a DLL can be obtained by browsing the Record Playback directory in Windows Explorer, right-clicking on the file name, and choosing Properties. The Version or Details tab of the Properties page provides details on the library version. The following table gives the first fixed version number for each DLL. If the installed versions are equal to or greater than the versions provided in the table, the system is not vulnerable.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">The WebEx meeting service is a hosted multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The WRF file format is used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players are applications that are used to play back and edit recording files (files with a .wrf extension). The WRF players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for stream playback mode). The WRF players can also be manually installed after downloading the application from www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html ["http://www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html"]to play back recording files locally (for offline playback mode).

The Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) Player is affected by the following vulnerabilities:



Cisco WebEx Player WRF Parsing Vulnerability

This vulnerability has been assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier: CVE-2011-3319



Cisco WebEx Player ATAS32 Processing Vulnerability

This vulnerability has been assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier: CVE-2011-4004



The vulnerabilities may cause the player application to crash or, in some cases, remote code execution could occur.

To exploit one of these vulnerabilities, the player application would need to open a malicious WRF file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file directly to users (for example, by using e-mail) or by directing a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities cannot be triggered by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">There are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

These vulnerabilities are first fixed in the following versions: 


    T26 SP49 EP40 
    T27 FR20 
    T27 SP11 EP23 
    T27 SP21 EP9 
    T27 SP23 
    T27 SP25 EP3 
    T27 SP28 

The client build is listed in the Support &gt; Downloads section of the WebEx page after a user authenticates. WebEx bug fixes are cumulative in a major release. For example, if release T27 SP22 EP9 is fixed, release T27 SP22 EP23 will also have the software fix.  End users will see a version such as "Client build: 27.25.4.11889." This indicates the server is running software version T27 SP25 EP4.

If a WRF player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site.

If a WRF player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html["http://www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html"]. If the player is no longer needed, it can be removed using the "Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller" or "Meeting Services Removal tool" available at support.webex.com/support/downloads.html["http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html"]
