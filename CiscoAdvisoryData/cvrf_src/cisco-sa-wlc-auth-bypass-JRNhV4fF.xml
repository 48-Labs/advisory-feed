    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the authentication functionality of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication controls and log in to the device through the management interface

This vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of the password validation algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with crafted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and log in to the device as an administrator. The attacker could obtain privileges that are the same level as an administrative user but it depends on the crafted credentials.

Note: This vulnerability exists because of a non-default device configuration that must be present for it to be exploitable. For details about the vulnerable configuration, see the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-auth-bypass-JRNhV4fF ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-auth-bypass-JRNhV4fF"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.10.151.0 or Release 8.10.162.0 and have macfilter radius compatibility configured as Other:

3504 Wireless Controller
5520 Wireless Controller

Note: The vulnerable releases noted above are available in the Software Center ["https://software.cisco.com/download/home"] on Cisco.com. In addition, specific customers have been given the following vulnerable escalation builds that are not in the Software Center:

8.10.151.4 to 8.10.151.10
8.10.162.1 to 8.10.162.14

Determine the Configuration

To determine whether the Cisco WLC configuration is vulnerable, issue the show macfilter summary CLI command. If RADIUS compatibility mode is other, as shown in the following example, the device is considered vulnerable:


wlc &gt; show macfilter summary

MAC Filter RADIUS Compatibility mode............. Other
MAC Filter Delimiter............................. Single-Hyphen
MAC Filter Entries............................... 0</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are workarounds that addresses this vulnerability. Choose one of the following based on the environment:

Option 1: No Macfilters in the Environment

Customers who do not use macfilters can reset the macfilter radius compatibility mode to the default value using the following CLI command:


wlc &gt; config macfilter radius-compat cisco

Option 2: Macfilters in the Environment

Customers who use macfilters and who are able to change the radius server configuration to match other possible compatibility modes can modify the macfilter compatibility to either cisco or free using one of the following CLI commands:


wlc &gt; config macfilter radius-compat cisco
wlc &gt; config macfilter radius-compat free

For more information about the different macfilter compatibility modes, see Cisco Wireless Controller Command Reference ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-10/cmd-ref/b-cr810/config_commands_j_to_q.html#wp4097683650"].

While these workarounds have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
