    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Discovery Protocol and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter Software could allow an attacker to execute code, cause the service to reload unexpectedly, or cause Cisco Discovery Protocol or LLDP database corruption on an affected device.

Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP are a Layer 2 protocols. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

In addition, a firmware release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2022-20686, CVE-2022-20687: Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter Link Layer Discovery Protocol Firmware Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device and cause the LLDP service to restart.

These vulnerabilities are due to missing length validation of certain LLDP packet header fields. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious LLDP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device and cause LLDP to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released firmware updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

CVE-2022-20688: Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter Cisco Discovery Protocol Firmware Denial of Service Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device and cause Cisco Discovery Protocol service to restart.

This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device and cause Cisco Discovery Protocol to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.

CVE-2022-20689, CVE-2022-20690: Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter Cisco Discovery Protocol Firmware Command Injection Vulnerabilities

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause Cisco Discovery Protocol memory corruption on an affected device.

These vulnerabilities are due to missing length validation checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read of the valid Cisco Discovery Protocol packet data, which could allow the attacker to cause corruption in the internal Cisco Discovery Protocol database of the affected device.

Cisco has released firmware updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

        <Description>There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, administrators may disable the affected feature.

To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol or LLDP on the LAN interface of a device, open the web UI and choose Network Setup &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; CDP &amp;LLDP. Then uncheck Enabled CDP or Enabled LLDP.

While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</Description>
