    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Secure Shell Version 2 (SSHv2) protocol of Cisco Aironet 1800 Series Access Points could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to high CPU utilization and an accumulation of SSHv2 connections.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of incoming SSHv2 connections that do not complete properly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of crafted SSHv2 connections to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to high CPU utilization and an accumulation of SSHv2 connections.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.




This advisory is available at the following link: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151113-aironet["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151113-aironet"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco Aironet 1800 Series Access Point devices running Release 8.1(131.0) are vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">To assess whether there is high CPU utilization and an accumulation of SSHv2 connections on a device, use the show proc cpu command in the CLI, and refer to the values of the CPU fields and the number of root processes named -cisco shell. If there is a high number of root processes named -cisco shell there is an accumulation of SSHv2 connections, as indicated in the following example:


#show proc cpu
Mem: 292804K used, 704332K free, 0K shrd, 0K buff, 41848K cached
CPU: 96.1% usr  1.9% sys  0.0% nic  0.0% idle  0.0% io  0.0% irq  1.9% sirq
