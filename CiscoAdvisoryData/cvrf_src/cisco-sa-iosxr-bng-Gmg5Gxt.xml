    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Broadband Network Gateway PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the PPPoE process to continually crash.

This vulnerability exists because the PPPoE feature does not properly handle an error condition within a specific crafted packet sequence. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of specific PPPoE packets from controlled customer premises equipment (CPE). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the PPPoE process to continually restart, resulting in a denial of service condition (DoS).

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is part of the September 2022 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2022 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74840"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they had the Broadband Network Gateway PPPoE enabled and were running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software:

ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers
IOS XRv 9000 Routers

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
  Determine Whether Broadband Network Gateway PPPoE is Enabled
To determine whether the Broadband Network Gateway PPPoE is enabled, see if pppoe padr session-unique relay-session-id is present under the broadband aggregation (BBA) group, as shown in the following example:


RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ASR9903#show running-config pppoe bba-group
!
pppoe bba-group PPPoE-Group
 pppoe padr session-unique relay-session-id
 tag ppp-max-payload minimum 1500 maximum 1500
 pado delay 5000
 control-packets priority 6
