Cisco IOS XE Software Fragmented Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing fragmented IP version 4 (IPv4) packets that undergo Network Address Translation (NAT) and high-speed logging (HSL). Additionally, application layer gateway (ALG) or zone-based policy firewall inspection of such packets may be needed to exploit this vulnerability.

This vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 packets. Packets destined to an affected device or IP version 6 (IPv6) packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large IPv4 packets that require fragmentation and reassembly when packets requiring ALG inspection traverse a device that is configured for NAT and HSL.

Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability if NAT, HSL and ALG are enabled on an affected device; these services are not enabled by default.

ALG inspection is enabled on a device when NAT is enabled. ALG inspection engines available on Cisco IOS XE depend on the software version and may include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.323, Skinny, Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), and other protocols.

Administrators can choose to disable any ALG inspection under the NAT configuration.

If the packet used in an exploit attempt does not require ALG inspection, this vulnerability can still be exploited if the zone-based policy firewall is configured, in addition to NAT and HSL, and processing such packets.

The following matrix shows the potential impact for a combination of enabled features and packets that may require ALG:


  Fragmented packets that may need ALG

  Fragmented packets that do not need ALG

NAT/HSL

  Vulnerable

  Not Vulnerable

NAT/HSL/zone-based policy firewall

  Vulnerable

  Vulnerable


To determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the ip nat inside or ip nat outside commands must be on different interfaces and at least one ip nat global configuration command must be in the configuration.

The show running-config | include ip nat command can be used to determine whether NAT is in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:
Router#show running-config | include ip nat
 ip nat inside
 ip nat outside
 ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
To determine whether ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration, use the show running-config | include ip nat privileged EXEC command. The presence of no ip nat service in the output of show run | include ip nat indicates that ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration.

The following is the output of show running-config | include ip nat in Cisco IOS XE Software that has the SIP ALG disabled in the NAT configuration:
Router#show running-config | include ip nat
ip nat inside
ip nat outside
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1 vrf sip
no ip nat service sip udp port 5060
no ip nat service sip tcp port 5060
If no ip nat service is not in the output of show running-config | include ip nat, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on the device is vulnerable.

To determine whether HSL has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the ip nat log translations flow-export command must be in the configuration.

The show running-config | include ip nat command can be used to determine whether HSL is in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:
Router#show running-config | include ip nat
 ip nat inside
 ip nat outside
 ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
 ip nat log translations flow-export v9 udp destination 10.10.0.1 1020 source GigabitEthernet 0/0/0


Cisco IOS XE Software Crafted TCP Packet Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could cause an affected device to reload or execute arbitrary code when processing crafted TCP packets that belong to a connection that is inspected by an AppNav-XE controller component. A device is vulnerable only if multiple AppNav-XE controllers are configured.

This vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 TCP packets. Packets destined to an affected device or IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.

The AppNav-XE controller component is not enabled by default.

To determine whether AppNav-XE with multiple controllers is configured on a device, use the show service-insertion appnav-controller-group privileged EXEC command. The presence of multiple IP addresses under the configured appnav-controller-group in the output of show service-insertion appnav-controller-group indicates that AppNav-XE with multiple controllers is configured on a device.

The following output is for AppNav-XE on Cisco IOS XE Software configured with multiple controllers:
Router# show service-insertion appnav-controller-group
All AppNav Controller Groups in service context
Appnav Controller Group : acg
Member Appnav Controller Count : 2
Members:
IP Address
 21.0.0.36
21.0.0.160

AppNav Controller : 21.0.0.36
Local AppNav Controller : Yes
Current status of AppNav Controller : Alive
  &lt;output suppressed&gt;
Cisco IOS XE Software Crafted IPv6 Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing crafted IPv6 packets when IPv6 is configured on an affected device.

This vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv6 packets destined to an affected device. Packets transiting an affected device or IPv4 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted IPv6 packets that require punt operations when a device is configured for IPv6.

Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected if IPv6 is enabled on an interface that is processing traffic. IPv6 is not enabled by default.

To determine whether IPv6 is enabled on an interface, use the show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address) privileged EXEC command. The presence of ipv6 enable and ipv6 address in the output of show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address) indicates that IPv6 is enabled.

The following is the output of the show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address) in Cisco IOS XE Software that shows the device is configured for IPv6:
Router# show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address) ipv6 enable  ipv6 address dhcp rapid-commit ipv6 address autoconfig  ipv6 address MANAGEMENT ::1FFF:0:0:0:3560/128 ipv6 address 2001:DB8::1/64

Cisco IOS XE Software Layer 4 Redirect Crafted Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packets when Layer 4 Redirect (L4R) is configured on an affected device.

This vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv4 or IPv6 subscriber packets transiting an affected device. In normal operation, those packets are redirected to specified servers when a device running Cisco IOS XE Software is configured for L4R functionality. Packets destined to an affected device cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packets that require Layer 4 redirection when a device that is configured for L4R.

Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected if L4R is configured. L4R is not enabled by default.

To determine whether L4R is configured on a device, use the show running-config | include redirect privileged EXEC command. The presence of redirect server-group and redirect to group in the output of show running-config | include redirect indicates that L4R is enabled.

The following is the output of show running-config | include redirect in Cisco IOS XE Software that shows the device is configured for L4R:
Router# show running-config | include redirect
  redirect server-group TEST_SERVER
  	redirect to group TEST_SERVER
Cisco IOS XE Software Common Flow Table Crafted Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could cause an affected device to reload when processing crafted IPv6 packets encapsulated in UDP IPv4 packets. A device is vulnerable only if Media Monitoring (MMON) traffic inspection or Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured.

This vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 UDP packets that are carrying IPv6 packets. Packets destined to an affected device, TCP IPv4 packets, or unencapsulated IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.

MMON or NBAR traffic inspection is not enabled by default.

To determine whether MMON inspection of traffic is configured on a device, use the show policy-map type performance-monitor privileged EXEC command. The presence of service-policy in the output of show policy-map type performance-monitor interface indicates that MMON is configured on a device.
The following output is for a device running Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured with MMON:
Router#show policy-map type performance-monitor
  Service-policy performance-monitor input: mmon_policy

    Class-map: class-default (match-any)
      0 packets, 0 bytes
      5 minute offered rate 0000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps
      Match: any
      Total Packets classified: 0
      Total Bytes classified: 0
      Monitor AOR: disabled

  Service-policy performance-monitor output: mmon_policy

    Class-map: class-default (match-any)
      0 packets, 0 bytes
      5 minute offered rate 0000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps
      Match: any
      Total Packets classified: 0
      Total Bytes classified: 0
      Monitor AOR: disabled ethernet 0/0
NBAR inspection of IPv6 tunneled traffic on devices running Cisco IOS XE Software is supported for Teredo and IPv6INIP tunnel types.

To determine whether NBAR inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured on a device, use the show running-config | include nbar.+(teredo|ipv6inip) privileged EXEC command. The presence of either ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic ipv6inip or ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic teredo in the output of show running-config | include nbar.+(teredo|ipv6inip) indicates that the NBAR inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured on a device.

The following output is for a device running Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured with NBAR traffic inspection for both Teredo and IPv6INIP tunnel types:
Router# show run | include nbar.+(teredo|ipv6inip)
 ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic ipv6inip
 ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic teredo
Determine the Running Software Version  The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS XE releases correspond to the Cisco IOS Software releases. For example, Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.2S is the software release for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS Release 15.2(2)S2. For more information about mappings between the Cisco IOS XE releases and their associated Cisco IOS releases, see the following:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_intro.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_intro.html"]

To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS XE Software is running on a device, administrators can issue the show version command. The following example shows Cisco IOS XE Software that is running IOS XE Software version 3.6.2S, which maps to Cisco IOS Software version 15.2(2)S2:

Router#show version
Cisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.2(2)S2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)
