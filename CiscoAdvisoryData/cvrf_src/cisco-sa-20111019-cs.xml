    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">CiscoWorks Common Services is a set of management services that are  shared by network management applications in a CiscoWorks solution set.

  CiscoWorks Common Services provides the foundation for CiscoWorks  applications to share a common model for data storage, login, user role  definitions, access privileges, security protocols, and navigation.  It creates a standard user experience for all management functions. It  also provides the common framework for all basic system level operations  such as installation, data management (including backup-restoration and  importing-exporting), event and message handling, job and process  management, and software updates.


CiscoWorks Common Services for Microsoft Windows contains a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system with the privileges of a system administrator.

The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the CiscoWorks Home Page component. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted URL to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system with the privileges of a system administrator.

This vulnerability affects CiscoWorks Common Services running only on Microsoft Windows.

This vulnerability could be exploited over the default management ports, TCP port 1741 or 443.

Note: The default management ports can be reconfigured on the server.
