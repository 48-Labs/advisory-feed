</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">The Cisco WLCs and Cisco WiSMs are responsible for system-wide wireless LAN functionality, including security policies, intrusion prevention, RF management, quality of service (QoS), and mobility. These devices communicate with controller-based access points over any Layer 2 (Ethernet) or Layer 3 (IP) infrastructure using the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) and the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol.



The Cisco WLC family of devices is affected by the following vulnerabilities:



Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (wIPS) Denial of Service Vulnerability 

The Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload by sending crafted IP packets to the affected device. This vulnerability affects Cisco WLCs that are configured with Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (wIPS). This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtx80743["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx80743"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1102.

Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability
A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists on the Cisco Wireless Access Points (AP) that are managed by Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) which could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the AP to reload by sending crafted Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets to the affected device. This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.



This vulnerability can be triggered by transit traffic and even if SIP features are disabled on the device.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCts87659["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts87659"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1103.

Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers HTTP Profiling Remote Code Execution Vulnerability 
The HTTP Profiling feature of Cisco WLC devices is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability that may allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device by sending a crafted UserAgent string. This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.



Only Cisco WLC Software version 7.3.101.0 is affected by this vulnerability. A device is vulnerable only if the HTTP Profiling feature is enabled.



To determine if the HTTP Profiling feature is enabled, issue the show wlan command and locate the "HTTP" option under the "Network Admission Control"' section.  The following example shows the feature enabled:



(WLC)&gt;show wlan 3
WLAN Identifier.................................. 3

Network Admission Control
  Client Profiling Status ....................... Enabled
   DHCP ......................................... Disabled
   HTTP ......................................... Enabled



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc15636["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc15636"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1104.



Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers SNMP Unauthorized Access Vulnerability
The Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by an unauthorized access vulnerability where an authenticated attacker could view and modify the configuration of an affected Cisco WLC via SNMP even if "management over wireless" feature is disabled.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCua60653["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua60653"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only)  and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1105.


</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">The following section contains information about a workaround, if available, for each vulnerability described in this security advisory.




Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (wIPS) Denial of Service Vulnerability 

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability besides disabling wIPS features in the Cisco WLC.



Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.



Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers HTTP Profiling Remote Code Execution Vulnerability 

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability besides disabling the HTTP Profiling feature in the Cisco WLC.



Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers SNMP Unauthorized Access Vulnerability

CPU based Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be configured to restrict SNMP access to the affected WLC. After ACLs are defined, they can be applied to the management interface, the access point manager (AP-manager) interface, or any of the dynamic interfaces for client data traffic or to the Network Processing Unit (NPU) interface for traffic to the controller CPU.
