    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unity Express contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.



The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input processed by the Cisco Unity Express software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to follow a malicious link that is designed to submit malicious requests to the affected software. If successful, the attacker could perform certain unauthorized actions on the vulnerable software, which could be used to conduct further attacks on the system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerabilities in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco Unity Express software prior to version 8.0 is supported only on NM-CUE, NM-CUE-EC, AIM-CUE, AIM2-CUE-K9, and NME-CUE hardware modules. Hardware modules NM-CUE and NM-CUE-EC reached the Last Day of Support on April 15, 2011. Hardware module AIM-CUE reached the End of Software Maintenance on September 27, 2011. Hardware modules AIM2-CUE-K9 and NME-CUE reached the End of Software Maintenance on December 1, 2012. Customers using these modules should contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a supported hardware option. 



These vulnerabilities were reported to Cisco by Jacob Holcomb of Independent Security Evaluators.</cvrf:Note>
