    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the virtualization layer of the Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services and Cisco ASA Context Aware (CX) Services could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
the a reload of the affected system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. The resolution includes upgrading the Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services Software or the Cisco ASA CX Services Software and the Cisco ASA Software. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150408-cxfp["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150408-cxfp"]



Note: Cisco ASA Software is affected by several other vulnerabilities described in the Cisco Security Advisory Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA Software, cisco-sa-20150408-asa.

Cisco ASA customers should review cisco-sa-20150408-asa before
determining an upgrade release for Cisco ASA Software.



Cisco Security Advisory Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA Software is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150408-asa["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150408-asa"]
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following products:


    Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services
    Cisco ASA Context-Aware (CX) Services 

The vulnerability does not depend on the software configuration.




Determining the Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services Software Version
To determine the running version of Cisco ASA FirePOWER Service Software, issue the show version command
from the Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services command-line interface, which an
administrator can access via the serial console, an SSH session to the
Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services management interface, or a session opened from the parent ASA
using the session command. 



The following example shows Cisco ASA FirePOWER software version 5.4.0:


&gt; show version

---------[ asasfr ]----------

Model                     : ASA5512 (72) Version 5.4.0 (Build 763)

UUID                      : 1401763c-a7a5-11e4-9cfd-92a5551c2e4f

VDB version               : 225

----------------------------------------------------


Customers using Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center to manage Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services systems can locate the software version of Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services in the Devices&gt;Device Management and double click on the device name. 



Determining the Cisco ASA-CX Services Software Version

To determine the running version of Cisco ASA CX Services Software, issue the show version command
from the Cisco ASA CX command-line interface, which an
administrator can access via the serial console, an SSH session to the
ASA CX management interface, or a session opened from the parent ASA
using the session command. 



The following example shows Cisco ASA CX software version 9.0.1(40):

asangfw&gt;show version
Cisco ASA CX Platform  9.0.1 (40)
Customers using Cisco Prime Security Manager (PRSM) to manage Cisco ASA
CX devices can locate the software version of Cisco ASA CX in the Device &gt; Devices panel of the Cisco PRSM window.

Determining the Cisco ASA Software Version
To determine the running version of Cisco ASA Software, administrators can issue the show version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco ASA Software version 9.2(1):


ciscoasa#show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1) 
Device Manager Version 7.4(1)

Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to
manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is
displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM
window.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services and Cisco ASA CX Services brings distinctive threat-focused
next-generation security services to the Cisco ASA 5500-X Series
Next-Generation Firewall products. 



Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services provides comprehensive protection from
known and advanced threats, including protection against targeted and
persistent malware attacks.



Cisco ASA CX Services is an add-on services service that extends the Cisco
ASA platform by delivering application and user ID awareness
capabilities for enhanced visibility and control of network traffic.



A
vulnerability in the virtualization layer of the Cisco ASA FirePOWER
Services and Cisco ASA Context Aware (CX) Services could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
the reload of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to
improper handling of crafted packets sent at a high rate. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of crafted packets to the management interface of the Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services or Cisco ASA CX Services. 




Note: Only traffic directed to the management interface of Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services or Cisco ASA CX Services can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be exploited via IP version 4 and IP version 6. Due to the nature of this vulnerability an upgrade of the Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services Software or Cisco ASA CX Services Software and of the parent Cisco ASA Software is needed.
