 Cisco IOS Software contains two vulnerabilities related to Cisco IOS
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and Cisco IOS Zone-Based Firewall features.
These vulnerabilities are:


    
    Memory leak in Cisco IOS Software
    
    Cisco IOS Software Denial of Service when processing specially
    crafted HTTP packets

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. 

Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not
available.

This advisory is posted at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-zbfw["%5B%5BPublication_URL%5D%5D"].




Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software
Security Advisory bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories.
Nine of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the
vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco
IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the September 2011
Bundled Publication.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">
Cisco IOS devices running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS Software are
affected by two vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS IPS and Cisco IOS Zone-Based
Firewall. The two vulnerabilities are independent of each other. Details to
confirm affected configurations are provided below.


    
    Memory leak in Cisco IOS Software

    A device that is configured for either Cisco IOS IPS or
    Cisco IOS Zone-Based Firewall (or both), may experience a memory leak under
    high rates of new session creation flows through the device.

    To determine if a device is configured with Cisco IOS IPS, log into
    the device and issue the show ip ips interfaces CLI command.
    If the output shows an IPS rule either in the inbound or outbound direction
    set, then the device is vulnerable. This example, shows a device with an IPS
    rule set on Interface Gigabit Ethernet 0/0 in the inbound direction:

    
    Router#show ip ips interfaces
    Interface Configuration
      Interface GigabitEthernet0/0
        Inbound IPS rule is example_ips_rule
        Outgoing IPS rule is not set
Router#
    
    A device that is not configured for Cisco IOS IPS will return a blank
    line. The following example shows a device on which Cisco IOS IPS is not
    configured:

    
    Router#show ip ips interfaces

Router#

    
    To determine whether a device is configured with Zone-Based Firewall,
    log into the device and issue the show zone security CLI
    command. If the output shows a member interface under a zone name, then the
    device is vulnerable. This example, shows a device with Zone-Based Firewall
    rules configured on both GigabitEthernet0/0 and GigabitEthernet0/1

    
    Router#show zone security
zone self
  Description: System defined zone


zone inside
  Description: *** Inside Network ***
  Member Interfaces:
    GigabitEthernet0/0


zone outside
  Description: *** Outside Network ***
  Member Interfaces:
    GigabitEthernet0/1


Router#
    
    Note: The device is vulnerable if configured with
    Zone-Based Firewall, regardless of the type of packet inspection being
    performed. 
    
    Cisco IOS Software Denial of Service when processing specially
    crafted HTTP packets

    A device is vulnerable if configured under the following
    circumstances: 

    - HTTP Layer 7 Application Control and Inspection and
    Cisco IOS IPS are enabled.

    - HTTP Layer 7 Application Control and Inspection with
    match request arg regex parameter on the HTTP class map. This configuration is
    affected regardless if Cisco IOS IPS is enabled or not.

    

    

    The device is not vulnerable under other configurations.
    A summary of different configurations and their affect by this vulnerability is
    provided below:

                match arg regex parameter. With or without Cisco IOS IPS
                enabled.

                
                
                Affected

                
            
            
                
                HTTP Layer 7 Application Control and Inspection without
                match arg regex parameter. With or without Cisco IOS IPS
                enabled.

    The following example shows an affected device configured with HTTP

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco
product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
show version command to display the system banner.
The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by
displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by
"Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not
have the show version command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco
IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of
C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:


Router&gt; show version
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Firewalls are networking devices that control access to the network
assets of an organization. Firewalls are often positioned at the
entrance points of networks. Cisco IOS Software provides a set of
security features that allow the configuration of a simple or elaborate
firewall policy according to particular requirements.

Cisco IOS IPS is an inline, deep-packet inspection feature that effectively mitigates a wide range of network attacks.

Memory leak in Cisco IOS Software



Devices with affected configurations may observe a memory leak under
high rates of new session creation flows through the device.



Logs may indicate a message similar to " *CCE: CCE 7
tuple table entry to add not malloced." or "CCE: CCE 7 tuple table
adding data to invalid hash entry." when the device experiences this
memory leak.



The output of show processes memory sorted
will show an increasing amount of memory being held in the "Chunk
Manager" process in the "Holding" column.  The following example shows
the output of the show processes memory sorted CLI command:


Router#show processes memory sorted
Processor Pool Total:  930768768 Used:   90497932 Free:  840270836
      I/O Pool Total:   12582912 Used:    6138704 Free:    6444208

For this particular vulnerability applying Zone-Based
Policy Firewall denial of service protection does not protect against
the memory leak due to Cisco Bug ID CSCtq28732["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq28732"]

Cisco IOS Software Denial of Service when processing specially crafted HTTP packets



Devices with affected configurations may hang or crash when processing a specially crafted HTTP packets.



If the device supports and is configured with scheduler isr-watchdog then the device will reset and reload if the vulnerability is exploited, rather than just hang.
