    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the IPSec VPN Server authentication functionality of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication controls and access the IPSec VPN network.

This vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of the password validation algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the VPN from an affected device with crafted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and access the IPSec VPN network. The attacker may obtain privileges that are the same level as an administrative user, depending on the crafted credentials that are used.

Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-vpnbypass-Cpheup9O ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-vpnbypass-Cpheup9O"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers if the IPSec VPN Server feature is enabled:

RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall
RV130 VPN Router
RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router
RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router
  Determine the Device Configuration
To determine whether the IPSec VPN Server feature is configured on a device, log in to the web-based management interface and choose VPN &gt; IPSec VPN Server &gt; Setup. If the Server Enable check box is checked, the IPSec VPN Server is enabled on the device. See Configuration of an IPSec VPN Server on RV130 and RV130W ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/smb/routers/cisco-rv-series-small-business-routers/smb4990-configuration-of-an-ipsec-vpn-server-on-rv130-and-rv130w.html"] for addition information on the IPSec VPN Server configuration.</cvrf:Note>
