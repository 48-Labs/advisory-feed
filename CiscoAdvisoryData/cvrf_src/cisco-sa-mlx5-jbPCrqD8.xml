    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

Routing and Switching - Enterprise and Service Provider

Cloud Services Router 1000V Series
IOS Software
IOS XE Software (other than Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software)
IOS XR Software
NX-OS Software</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">If an error condition is observed on the device interface, the device may either reload or fail to receive traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="6">If Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software is using the MLX5 driver and it is affected by this issue, administrators would see that traffic is not being received on the interface and rx_errors will increase on the affected interface, as shown in the following example where interface GigabitEthernet2 has been affected:


cat8kv#show control | include ^GigabitEthernet.*|rx_errors
GigabitEthernet1 - Gi1 is mapped to UIO on VXE
  rx_errors 0
GigabitEthernet2 - Gi2 is mapped to UIO on VXE
rx_errors 20
GigabitEthernet3 - Gi3 is mapped to UIO on VXE
  rx_errors 0
cat8kv#</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="7">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability; however, a recovery mechanism exists in Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software.

Using the example shown in the Indicators of Compromise ["#ioc"] section of this advisory, where GigabitEthernet2 was affected, the commands in the following example show the recovery technique of shut/no shut:


cat8kv#show control | include ^GigabitEthernet.*|rx_errors
GigabitEthernet1 - Gi1 is mapped to UIO on VXE
  rx_errors 0
GigabitEthernet2 - Gi2 is mapped to UIO on VXE
