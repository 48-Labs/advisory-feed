    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability in the IP version 6
(IPv6) protocol stack implementation that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device
that has IPv6 operation enabled. The vulnerability is triggered when an
affected device processes a malformed IPv6 packet.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-ipv6["%5B%5BPublication_URL%5D%5D"].



Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software
Security Advisory bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories.
Nine of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the
vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco
IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the September 2011
Bundled Publication. 

 Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response:
Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the
following link:

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects devices that are running Cisco IOS
Software and configured for IPv6 operation. IPv6 is not enabled by
default in Cisco IOS Software.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco devices that are running an affected version of Cisco IOS
Software and configured for IPv6 operation are affected. A device that
is running Cisco IOS Software and that has IPv6 enabled will show some
interfaces with assigned IPv6 addresses when the show ipv6 interface brief command is executed.

The show ipv6 interface brief command will
produce an error message if the running version of Cisco IOS Software
does not support IPv6, or will not show any interfaces with IPv6 address
if IPv6 is disabled. The system is not vulnerable in either of these
scenarios.

Sample output of the show ipv6 interface brief command on a system that is configured for IPv6 operation follows:


router&gt;show ipv6 interface brief 
FastEthernet0/0            [up/up]
    FE80::222:90FF:FEB0:1098
    2001:DB8:2:93::3
    200A:1::1
FastEthernet0/1            [up/up]
    FE80::222:90FF:FEB0:1099
    2001:DB8:2:94::1
Serial0/0/0                [down/down]
    unassigned
Serial0/0/0.4              [down/down]
    unassigned
Serial0/0/0.5              [down/down]
    unassigned
Serial0/0/0.6              [down/down]
    unassigned

Alternatively, the IPv6 protocol is enabled if the interface configuration command ipv6 address  or ipv6 enable is present in the configuration. Both may be present, which the vulnerable configuration in the following example shows:


interface FastEthernet0/1
 ipv6 address 2001:0DB8:C18:1::/64 eui-64
!
interface FastEthernet0/2
 ipv6 enable

A device that is running Cisco IOS Software and has IPv6 enabled on a physical or logical interface is vulnerable even if ipv6 unicast-routing
is globally disabled (that is, the device is not routing IPv6 packets). Administrators can use
the show ipv6 interface brief command to determine whether IPv6 is enabled on any interface.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running
on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue
the show version command to display the system banner.
The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software
by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System
Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in
parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release
name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is
running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image
name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:


Router&gt; show version
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco IOS XR Software and Cisco IOS XE Software are not affected by this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">IPv6, which was designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF), is intended to replace the current version, IP Version 4 (IPv4).

A vulnerability exists when Cisco IOS Software processes IPv6
packets. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending
malformed IPv6 packets to physical or logical interfaces that are
configured to process IPv6 traffic. Transit traffic cannot trigger this
vulnerability. Exploitation could cause an affected system to reload.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtj41194["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj41194"]
(registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only)
, and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-0944.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">There are no workarounds for this vulnerability if IPv6 configuration is required.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.


In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Cisco IOS Software
Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a
Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the
earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed
Release For This Advisory column. The First Fixed Release for All
Advisories in the September 2011 Bundled Publication column lists the
earliest possible releases that correct all the published
vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled
publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release,
where possible.
