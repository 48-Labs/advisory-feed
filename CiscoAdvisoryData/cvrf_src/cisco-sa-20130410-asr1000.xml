    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">For specific version information, refer to the Software Versions and Fixes section of this advisory.

Cisco IOS XE Software IPv6 Multicast Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability and Cisco IOS XE Software MVPNv6 Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are triggered when a fragmented multicast IP version 6 (IPv6) or a fragmented IPv6 Multicast VPN (MVPNv6) packet is received by an affected Cisco ASR device. The fragmented multicast packet processed by Cisco Multicast Leaf Recycle Elimination (MLRE) may cause a Cisco ESP card on the Cisco ASR device to reload.
Multiple features configured on the Cisco ASR 1000 may trigger this kind of processing that will lead to a crash.

Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected if IPv6 is enabled on an interface that is processing traffic and MLRE is enabled on the affected device.

To determine whether IPv6 is enabled on an interface use the show run | include ipv6.(enable|address)
privileged EXEC command. The presence of ipv6 enable and ipv6 address  in the output of show run | include ipv6.(enable|address) indicates that IPv6 is enabled.
The following is the output of the show run | include ipv6.(enable|address) in a Cisco IOS XE Software that shows the device is configured for IPv6:

asr1004# show run | include ipv6.(enable|address)
 ipv6 enable
 ipv6 address dhcp rapid-commit
 ipv6 address autoconfig   ipv6 address MANAGEMENT ::1FFF:0:0:0:3560/128
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8::1/64
    There is currently no way to determine if Cisco MLRE is enabled on the device.

Note: The Cisco MLRE feature is introduced in Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.4.1S and is enabled by default on all later versions of Cisco IOS XE Software on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with Embedded Services Processor 40 (ASR1000-ESP40) or Embedded Services Processor 100 (ASR1000-ESP100). Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with Embedded Services Processor 40 (ASR1000-ESP40) or Embedded Services Processor 100 (ASR1000-ESP100) are affected by this vulnerability.

To determine whether a Cisco ASR 1000 device has ASR1000-ESP40 or ASR1000-ESP100 installed, administrators can issue the show inventory command. The following is the output of the show inventory in a Cisco IOS XE Software running on a Cisco ASR 1006 Router with Embedded Services Processor 40 (ASR1000-ESP40):

  asr1006#show inventory   NAME: "Chassis", DESCR: "Cisco ASR1006 Chassis"  PID: ASR1006            NAME: "module F1", DESCR: "Cisco ASR1000 Embedded Services Processor, 40Gbps"  PID: ASR1000-ESP40      &lt;output suppressed&gt;
    Note: Cisco IOS devices configured to process multicast IPv6 or MVPNv6 traffic are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.

  Cisco IOS XE Software L2TP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload when processing of a large amount of specific Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) packets when L2TP Network Server (LNS) termination or L2TPv3 Ethernet Pseudowire (xconnect) is enabled. L2TP LNS termination and xconnect are not enabled by default.

To verify if L2TP LNS termination is enabled on a device use the show run | include accept-dialin privileged EXEC command. The presence of accept-dialin in the output of show run | include accept-dialin indicates that L2TP LNS termination is enabled.

The following is the output of the show run | include accept-dialin on Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured as an L2TP Network Server (LNS):

asr1004#sho running-config | include accept-dialin
accept-dialin

  To verify if xconnect is enabled on a device use the show run | include xconnect|l2tpv3 privileged EXEC command. The presence of encapsulation l2tpv3 and xconnect in the output of show run | include xconnect|l2tpv3 indicates that xconnect is enabled.

The following is the output of the show run | include xconnect|l2tpv3 on Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured for xconnect:
asr1004#sho running-config | include xconnect|l2tpv3
encapsulation l2tpv3
xconnect 10.0.0.1 1000 encapsulation l2tpv3 pw-class my_class

Note: Cisco IOS devices configured with L2TPv3 Ethernet Pseudowire (xconnect) or as L2TP LNS are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco IOS XE Software Bridge Domain Interface Denial of Service Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload during the processing of packets when the bridge domain interface (BDI) feature is configured.

Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

The physical interface that processes the packet on the ingress path is the layer 3 interface that has the encapsulation type set to untagged.
The incoming packet is routed through a BDI interface.
The egress physical interface of the packet has the encapsulation set to rewrite VLAN.
  Note: The BDI feature is not configured by default.

To verify if the above conditions are satisfied on a device use the show run | section interface privileged EXEC command. The following is the output of show run | section interface in Cisco IOS XE software on a device configured with the vulnerable BDI setting:
asr1004#sho running-config | section interface
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/3
        ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
        !          interface BDI20          ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
!        interface GigabitEthernet0/0/4          no ip address          negotiation auto          service instance 1 ethernet          encapsulation dot1q 201          rewrite egress tag pop 1 symmetric          bridge-domain 20

  Note: This feature was introduced on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers in Cisco IOS XE Software version 3.2.0S.

Note: Cisco IOS devices configured for BDI are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco IOS XE Software SIP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets that undergo Network Address Translation (NAT) within Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance and SIP Application Layer Gateway (ALG) inspection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of SIP packets traversing a device configured for NAT.

Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability if VRF-aware NAT and SIP ALG is enabled on an affected device; these services are not enabled by default.

SIP ALG is enabled on a device as soon as NAT is enabled. Administrators can choose to disable SIP ALG inspection under NAT configuration.

SIP ALG can also be enabled under Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) configuration. Devices configured for SIP ALG under ZBFW are not affected by this vulnerability.

To determine whether VRF-aware NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, either ip nat inside or ip nat outside commands must be present in different interfaces, and at least one ip nat global configuration command must have a vrf keyword.

The show running-config | include ip (nat | .* vrf .*) command can be used to determine whether VRF-aware NAT is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:

asr1004#show running-config | include ip (nat | .* vrf .*)
 ip nat inside
 ip nat outside
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1 vrf VRF-SIP




If the output is empty, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on a given device is not vulnerable. If the output returned is not empty, SIP ALG services may be explicitly disabled under NAT configuration. To determine whether SIP ALG is disabled under NAT configuration, use the show run | include ip nat privileged EXEC command. The presence of no ip nat service sip in the output of show run | include ip nat indicates that SIP ALG is disabled under NAT configuration.

The following is the output of show run | include ip nat in Cisco IOS XE Software that has the SIP ALG disabled under NAT configuration:


      asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat
       ip nat inside
       ip nat outside
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1 vrf sip
no ip nat service sip udp port 5060
no ip nat service sip tcp port 5060

If no ip nat service sip is not present in the output of show run | include ip nat, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on the device is vulnerable.

Note: Cisco IOS devices configured for SIP ALG inspection are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.

  Determine the Running Software Version  Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS XE Software releases correspond to the Cisco IOS Software releases. For example, Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.6.2S is the software release for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS Software Release 15.2(2)S2.

 ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_intro.html"]
To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS XE Software is running on a device, administrators can issue the show version command. The following example shows a Cisco IOS XE Software that is running IOS XE software version 3.6.2S, IOS version 15.2(2)S2:



asr1004#show version
Cisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.2(2)S2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)
