    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco TelePresence ISDN Gateway contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger the drop of the data channel (D-channel),
causing all calls to be terminated and preventing users from making new
calls.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. No workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140122-isdngw["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140122-isdngw"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All releases of Cisco TelePresence ISDN Gateway Software prior to 2.2(1.92) running on Cisco TelePresence ISDN GW 3241 or Cisco TelePresence ISDN GW MSE 8321
are affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco TelePresence ISDN Gateway is a high-performance video gateway that enables ISDN network connectivity for Cisco TelePresence IP-based video infrastructure products as well as IP-based endpoints.



A vulnerability in the code handling the ISDN Q.931 signaling
protocol  of the Cisco TelePresence ISDN Gateway could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a drop of the data channel (D-channel),
causing all calls to be terminated and preventing users from making new
calls.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a crafted
Q.931 STATUS message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
injecting crafted packets in the Q.931 flow. An successful exploit could allow
the attacker to trigger a drop of the D-channel. As a result, all active calls handled by the affected
system will be terminated and it will not be possible to establish new calls until the D-channel
communication is restored. A software reload is necessary to restore normal behavior.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID  CSCui50360["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui50360"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only)and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-0660.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
