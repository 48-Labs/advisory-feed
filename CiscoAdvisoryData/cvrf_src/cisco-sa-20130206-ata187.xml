    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco ATA 187 Analog Telephone Adaptor firmware versions 9.2.1.0 and 9.2.3.1 contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the operating system of the affected device.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.



This advisory is available at the following link: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130206-ata187["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130206-ata187"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2"></cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The Cisco ATA 187 Analog Telephone Adaptor is affected by this vulnerability when it is running firmware version 9.2.1.0 or 9.2.3.1.



To check the firmware version on the Cisco ATA 187 Analog Telephone Adaptor, an administrator can view the SW_Version ID field on the device web interface.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The following Cisco products are confirmed not vulnerable:


    Cisco ATA 186 Analog Telephone Adaptor
    Cisco ATA 188 Analog Telephone Adaptor

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco ATA 187 Analog Telephone Adaptor firmware versions 9.2.1.0 and 9.2.3.1 contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the operating system of the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of authentication on TCP port 7870 and improper authorization of commands within the operating system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the affected system and sending arbitrary commands.

This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtz67038["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz67038"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1111.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">It is possible to terminate the listening Telnet process on the device by accessing the device remotely, listing the processes, and then terminating the Telnet process.  This prevents further remote access to the device until the device is reloaded.
