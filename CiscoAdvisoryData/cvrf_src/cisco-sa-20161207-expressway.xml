  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the HTTP traffic server component of Cisco Expressway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to initiate TCP connections to arbitrary hosts. This does not allow for full traffic proxy through the Expressway.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control for TCP traffic passed through the Cisco Expressway. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL through the Cisco Expressway. An exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate hosts and services of arbitrary hosts, as well as degrade performance through the Cisco Expressway.



There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
