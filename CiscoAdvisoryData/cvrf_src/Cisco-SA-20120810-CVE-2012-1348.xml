    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Wide Area Application Services Appliances software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. 



The vulnerability is due to a design error that allows user passwords to be displayed within output text as a one-way hash on a vulnerable system. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a brute-force attack on the one-way hash of a password. If the brute-force attack is successful, the attacker could access sensitive information to gain unauthorized access to the targeted system, which could be used to launch additional attacks.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability and released software updates.




The user passwords are displayed as a one-way hash, which can make it difficult to decipher. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must perform another attack such as a brute-force attack on the one-way hash. To achieve this objective, the attacker may need access to trusted, internal network resources. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful attack.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
