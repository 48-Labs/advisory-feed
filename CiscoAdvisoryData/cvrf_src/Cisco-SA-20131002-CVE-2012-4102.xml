    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the activate firmware command of the Cisco Unified
Computing System fabric interconnect could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to execute commands and obtain an interactive Linux shell
as the root user.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to
properly sanitize user input. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by inserting Linux shell commands into a parameter using
common techniques. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
execute any command on the Linux shell as the root user. The attacker
could also gain complete access to the underlying operating system by
obtaining an interactive Linux shell as the root user.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and has released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires authenticated access to the targeted system. Authenticated access may require the attacker to access trusted, internal networks. These access requirements could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">
