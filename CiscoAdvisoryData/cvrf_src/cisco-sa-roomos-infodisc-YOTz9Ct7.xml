    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) and RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system.

This vulnerability is due to the storage of certain unencrypted credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to access confidential information, some of which may contain personally identifiable information (PII).

Note: To access the logs that are stored in the RoomOS Cloud, an attacker would need valid Administrator-level credentials.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-roomos-infodisc-YOTz9Ct7 ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-roomos-infodisc-YOTz9Ct7"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco devices if they were running a vulnerable release of the following Cisco software and had extended logging mode enabled:

TelePresence CE Software
RoomOS Software in Cloud-Aware On-Premises operation, which is cloud based

Note: Extended logging mode is disabled by default. If it is enabled, a full capture of network traffic will be included in the logs. PII will also be included.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
  Determine Whether Extended Logging Mode is Enabled
To determine whether extended logging mode is enabled, complete the following steps:

Choose the Cisco device name or address.
For all products except Board Pro, Desk Mini, and Desk Hub, it is at the top of the interface.
For Board Pro and Desk Mini, swipe in from the right to open the Control Panel.
For Desk Hub, tap the controls icon in the upper right corner to open the Control Panel.

Choose Device settings (Board Pro, Desk Mini, or Desk Hub) or Settings (other products).
Open Issues and diagnostics and check the extended logging toggle button.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. Administrators can disable extended logging mode it by completing the following steps:

Choose the Cisco device name or address.
For all products except Board Pro, Desk Mini, and Desk Hub, it is at the top of the interface.
For Board Pro and Desk Mini, swipe in from the right to open the Control Panel.
For Desk Hub, tap the controls icon in the upper right corner to open the Control Panel.

Choose Device settings (Board Pro, Desk Mini, or Desk Hub) or Settings (other products).
Open Issues and diagnostics and find the extended logging toggle button and turn it off.

While this workaround has proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
