    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service contains a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an interruption of presence services.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.  



There are no workarounds available to mitigate exploitation of this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130821-cup["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130821-cup"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All versions of Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service prior to 9.1(2) are affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.



Determining Cisco Unified Presence Software Versions



To determine the running version of Cisco Unified Presence software, issue the show version active command from the command-line interface.



The following example shows Cisco Unified Presence software version 8.6.0:


admin: show version active
Active Master Version: 8.6.0.97041-43
