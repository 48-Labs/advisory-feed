    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) contain a vulnerability that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. 



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available. 



Note: This security advisory has been updated to include important information about Cisco WSA



This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120126-ironport["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120126-ironport"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following products running an affected version of Cisco AsyncOS Software are affected:


    All models of Cisco ESA hardware appliances
    All models of Cisco SMA hardware appliances
    All models of Cisco WSA both hardware and virtual appliances

Note: The Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco WSA is affected by this vulnerability only if the  System Setup Wizard (SSW) has not been performed as the Telnet access is disabled after the setup is completed. 

Cisco WSA will not fully operate unless the SSW has completed; this limits the scope of the vulnerability on Cisco WSA.



This vulnerability can only be exploited if Telnet is enabled on the affected system for remote access. To determine whether the system has Telnet enabled, administrators can use the netstat command and verify that the default Telnet TCP port 23 is in listening state. The following example shows a Cisco ESA with telnet enabled:






ciscoesa&gt; netstat

Active Internet connections (including servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address       (state)
[...]
tcp4       0      0 172.18.254.80.21       *.*                    LISTEN
tcp4       0      0 172.18.254.80.22       *.*                    LISTEN
tcp4       0      0 172.18.254.80.23       *.*                    LISTEN      

[...]

Determining the Running Software Version
To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS
Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco  AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA Software version 7.6.2-201:


ciscoesa&gt; version
Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance
Model: X1070
Version: 7.6.2-201
[...]
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco ESA provides email management and protection combining antispam, antivirus, encryption, digital rights management, and archiving technologies. The Cisco SMA is a flexible management tool designed to centralize and consolidate policy and runtime data, providing a single management interface for multiple Cisco IronPort security appliances. 



The Cisco WSA is a secure web gateway that combines
advanced malware protection, application visibility and control (AVC),
acceptable use policy controls, reporting, and secure mobility on a
single platform.



A vulnerability in telnet code of Cisco AsyncOS could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to to execute arbitrary code on the
affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary
checks when processing telnet encryption keys.  An unauthenticated,
remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious
requests to a targeted system.  If successful, the attacker could
execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges.






Note: The Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco WSA is affected by this vulnerability only if the  System Setup Wizard (SSW) has not been performed as the Telnet access is disabled after the setup is completed. 

Cisco WSA will not fully operate unless the SSW has completed; this limits the scope of the vulnerability on Cisco WSA.



This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug IDs CSCzv32432["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv32432"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco ESA, CSCzv44580["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv44580"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco SMA, and CSCuo90523["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuo90523"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco WSA.



The vulnerability was previously documented in Cisco IronPort bug 83262. Cisco IronPort tracks bugs using an internal system that is not
available to customers. The Cisco IronPort bug tracking identifiers are
provided for reference only.



This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-4862.




</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">For some versions of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA and Cisco SMA, Telnet is configured on the Management port. Telnet services can be disabled to mitigate this vulnerability. Administrators can disable Telnet by using the administration graphical user interface (GUI) or by using the interfaceconfig command in the command-line interface (CLI). As a security best practice, customers should use Secure Shell (SSH) instead of Telnet.



Complete the following steps to disable Telnet via the GUI:



Step 1: Navigate to Network &gt; IP Interfaces &gt; interface_name.

Step 2: Remove the check from the box next to the Telnet service.

Step 3: Click on the Submit button to submit the change.

Step 4: Click the Commit Change button for these changes to take effect.



Use the interfaceconfig command, as shown in the example below to disable Telnet via the CLI.


ciscoesa&gt; interfaceconfig

Currently configured interfaces:
1. Data 1 (192.168.1.1/24 on Data1: mail3.example.com)
2. Data 2 (192.168.2.1/24 on Data2: mail3.example.com)
3. Management (192.168.42.42/24 on Management: mail3.example.com)

Choose the operation you want to perform:
- NEW - Create a new interface.
- EDIT - Modify an interface.
- GROUPS - Define interface groups.
- DELETE - Remove an interface.

[]&gt; edit
Enter the number of the interface you wish to edit.
[]&gt; 3

&lt;..output omitted&gt;

Do you want to enable Telnet on this interface? [N]&gt; N
Do you want to enable SSH on this interface? [N]&gt; Y

Note: The interfaceconfig command is described in detail in the section Other Tasks in the GUI in the Cisco AsyncOS Daily Management Guide available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/esa/esa7.5/ESA_7.5_Daily_Management_Guide.pdf



Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco WSA has Telnet enabled by default; however once SSW is completed, telnet will be automatically disabled.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult
the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.


In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded
contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and
software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the
new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to
contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted
maintenance providers.
