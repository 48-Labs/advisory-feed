These vulnerabilities can be exploited independently; however, more than one vulnerability could be exploited on the same device.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate some of these vulnerabilities are available.  This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130508-cvp ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130508-cvp"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco Unified CVP Software versions prior to 9.0.1 ES 11 are vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco Unified CVP is an interactive voice response (IVR) system that enables customers to retrieve information they need from the contact center.

Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software SIP INVITE Packet Vulnerability
A malformed SIP INVITE vulnerability exists in the CallServer component of the Cisco Unified CVP could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the  system to not accept new calls.
The vulnerability is due to  improper processing of malformed SIP INVITE packets. An attacker could  exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SIP INVITE packets to a  Cisco Unified CVP server.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCua65148 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua65148"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1220.

Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability
A Tomcat web application vulnerability in the Tomcat Web Management component of the Cisco Unified CVP could allow an unauthenticated, remote  attacker to escalate privileges and gain administrator access.
The vulnerability is due to improper configuration of Tomcat components.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCub38384 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38384"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1221.

Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Tomcat Configuration Vulnerability
A Tomcat web application vulnerability in the Tomcat Web Management component of the Cisco Unified CVP could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute unauthorized user-supplied web applications.
The vulnerability is due to improper configuration of Tomcat components.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCub38379 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38379"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1222.

Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software File Access Vulnerability
A file access vulnerability in the log viewer of the Cisco Unified CVP could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view arbitrary system files.
The vulnerability is due to an incorrect parameter check. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the log viewer.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCub38372 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38372"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1223.

Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Path Traversal Vulnerability
A path traversal vulnerability in the Resource Manager component of the Cisco Unified CVP that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to overwrite system files.
The vulnerability is due to an incorrect parameter check. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Resource Manager.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCub38369 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38369"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1224.

Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability
A file access vulnerability in the Cisco Unified CVP that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view arbitrary system files.
The vulnerability is due to a missing check for XML entity expansion. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Resource Manager.
This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCub38366 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38366"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1225.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">A workaround is available for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCub38366 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38366"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only).

To implement the  workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability, the communication  between the Cisco Unified CVP devices must be secured using SSL.  For more information on how to secure the communications between Cisco Unified CVP devices, refer to the "Unified CVP security" section of the Configuration and Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal at the following location:

http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/customer_voice_portal/cvp9_0/configuration/guide/cvp-configuration-and-administration-guide.pdf ["http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/customer_voice_portal/cvp9_0/configuration/guide/cvp-configuration-and-administration-guide.pdf"]

        <Description>A workaround is available for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCub38366 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38366"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only).

To implement the  workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability, the communication  between the Cisco Unified CVP devices must be secured using SSL.  For more information on how to secure the communications between Cisco Unified CVP devices, refer to the "Unified CVP security" section of the Configuration and Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal at the following location:

To implement the  workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability, the Manager and Host-Manager web applications must be removed manually from the Tomcat instances on CVP servers. Follow the instructions to remove the Manager and Host-Manager web applications:

Stop the services of respective server:

The ���manager��� and ���host-manager��� web applications need to be manually removed from Tomcat instances of your CVP servers.

  CVP VXML Server
Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.

CVP Call  Server
Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.

CVP Operation  Console Server
Go to the  C:\Cisco\CVP\OPSConsoleServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete  the Manager and Host-Manager folders.

CVP Reporting Server
Go  to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete  the Manager and Host-Manager folders.
  A workaround is available for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance documented in Cisco Bug ID  CSCub38379 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38379"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only).

To implement the  workaround for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance, follow these steps:

Stop the service of VXML Server:

Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\conf folder and edit server.xml file.

Modify autoDeploy to false. Earlier it was true.

&lt;Host appBase="webapps" autoDeploy="false"

Start the Service VXML server.
