  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the integrity and availability of the affected system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to validate user-supplied input used in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs including SQL statements. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity and availability of some functions.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be able to authenticate to a targeted device to submit malicious SQL statements. In addition, the attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside. These access requirements could reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">
Customers are advised to consult Cisco bug ID CSCug90502["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug90502"] for a complete list of affected product versions.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">At the time this alert was first published, Cisco ISE versions 1.2 and prior were vulnerable. Later releases of Cisco ISE Software may also be vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Administrators are advised to contact the vendor regarding future updates and releases.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.
