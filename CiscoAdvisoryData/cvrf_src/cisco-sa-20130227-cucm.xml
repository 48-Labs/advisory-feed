    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains two vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an interruption of voice services.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130227-cucm["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130227-cucm"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2"></cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following products are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:


    Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.6(x)
    Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0(x)



Note: Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 6.1 reached the End of Software Maintenance on September 3, 2011. Customers using Cisco Unified Communications Manager 6.x versions should contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco Unified Communications Manager.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The following products are not affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.


    Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.x
    Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.5(x)



No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco Unified Communications Manager is the call processing component of the Cisco IP Telephony solution that extends enterprise telephony features and functions to packet telephony network devices, such as IP phones, media processing devices, VoIP gateways, and multimedia applications. 



Malformed UDP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability



Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains a DoS vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an exhaustion of resources in the CPU. This vulnerability is triggered by receiving malformed packets on unused UDP ports and could result in an inability to connect to the graphical user interface (GUI) and an interruption of voice services.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtx43337["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx43337"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities Enumerator (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1133. This vulnerability applies to Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 8.6(x) and above and is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 9.0(1), 8.6(4) BE3k and 8.6(2a)su2. Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1(x) and 8.5(x) versions are not affected.



Location Bandwidth Manager (LBM) Cache Poisoning Vulnerability



Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0 contains a vulnerability
that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to poison the
Location Bandwidth Manager (LBM) transaction records.



The
vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication of the remote LBM Hub
node in the Intracluster communication between LBMs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by poisoning the LBM transaction records to consume all available bandwidth pools.  An
exploit could allow the attacker to consume all bandwidth and deny
calls. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCub28920["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub28920"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1134. This vulnerability applies to Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 9.0(x) only and is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 9.1(1). Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1(x), 8.5(x) and 8.6(x) versions are not affected.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Filtering traffic on TCP port 9004 from untrusted sources can provide a workaround for the LBM vulnerability.



Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in the network are available in the companion document "Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco IOS Software Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability" at the following location: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28034["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28034"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or later than the release in the "Recommended Release" column of the table.




    
        
            Cisco Unified Communication Manager Version
            Recommended Release
        
        
            8.x
            8.6(4)BE3K, 8.6(2a)su2

            

            
        
        
            9.x
