  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.

This vulnerability exists because the web UI does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid agent credentials.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. There is a mitigation that addresses this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ece-xss-CbtKtEYc ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ece-xss-CbtKtEYc"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ECE if it had the inbound email security policy of the rich text content policy disabled.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

Determine the Rich Text Content Policy Configuration

To determine the status of the inbound email security policy setting of the Cisco ECE server rich text content policy, connect to the ECE System Console or Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise (PCCE) Single Pane of Glass (SPOG), and choose Digital Channels &gt; Chat and Email &gt; Partition &gt; Security &gt; Rich Text Content Policy.

If the inbound email security policy setting is enabled, the system is not affected by this vulnerability. If the setting is disabled, the system is affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, enabling the inbound email security policy setting of the Cisco ECE server rich text content policy mitigates this vulnerability.

To enable this setting, connect to the UCCE System Console and choose Digital Channels &gt; Chat and Email &gt; Partition &gt; Security &gt; Rich Text Content Policy. Change the inbound email security policy setting to enabled.

While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
