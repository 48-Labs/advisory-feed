    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Products running Cisco IOS versions 12.0S, 12.2, 12.3 or 12.4 and  configured for MPLS VPNs or VRF Lite are potentially affected.

 Cisco IOS releases based on 12.1 are not affected.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco IOS devices are vulnerable if they are configured for MPLS VPN or  VRF Lite and have a BGP session between the CE and PE devices, and process  extended communities. If a device is configured for MPLS VPN or VRF Lite the  command address-family ipv4 vrf  &lt;vrf-name&gt; or  address-family ipv6 vrf  &lt;vrf-name&gt; will be present in the  device configuration.

 The following shows a command executed on a device  configured for MPLS VPN:


router#show running-config | include address-family [ipv4|ipv6]
 address-family ipv4 vrf &lt;vrf-name&gt;

The following shows a PE device configured for an IPv4 BGP session  between the PE and the CE:


router bgp &lt;Local AS&gt;
 address-family ipv4 vrf one  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; remote-as &lt; Remote AS&gt;  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; activate

To determine the software running on a Cisco product, log in to the  device and issue the "show version" command to display the system banner. Cisco  IOS software will identify itself as "Internetwork Operating System Software"  or simply "IOS". On the next line of output, the image name will be displayed  between parentheses, followed by "Version" and the IOS release name. Other  Cisco devices will not have the "show version" command or will give different  output.

 The following example identifies a Cisco product that is  running Cisco IOS release 12.4(11)T2:


Router#show version
Cisco IOS Software, 7200 Software (C7200-ADVSECURITYK9-M), Version 12.4(11)T2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc4) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2007 by Cisco Systems, Inc. Compiled Tue 01-May-07 04:19 by prod_rel_team  &lt;output truncated&gt;

Additional information on the Cisco IOS release naming conventions can  be found on the document entitled "White Paper: Cisco IOS Reference Guide",  which is available at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco products not configured for MPLS VPNs or VRF Lite are unaffected  by this vulnerability.

 Cisco products that do not run IOS are unaffected by this  vulnerability.

 Cisco IOS-XR is not affected.

 No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected  by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">MPLS VPNs allow for the creation of 'virtual networks' that customers  can use to segregate traffic into multiple, isolated VPNs. Traffic within each  MPLS VPN is kept separate from the others, thereby maintaining a virtual  private network.

 More information on MPLS and MPLS VPNs is available at the  following link:

  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6557/products_ios_technology_home.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6557/products_ios_technology_home.html"]

 A bug exists when processing extended communities with MPLS  VPNs. If extended communities are used, MPLS VPN may incorrectly use a  corrupted route target (RT) to forward traffic. If this occurs, traffic can  leak from one MPLS VPN to another.

 This vulnerability exists whenever an affected PE device  has a BGP session running in the MPLS VPN Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF).  The following two examples of this scenario are the most common:

 1) MPLS VPN configuration with BGP running inside the VRF  between the PE and CE devices.

 2) MPLS Inter-AS option A with BGP running between the  Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBR).

 The mitigation in the Workarounds section filters extended  communities on a PE device, preventing them from being received by devices  configured for MPLS VPN.

 This vulnerability was introduced with Cisco bug ID  CSCee83237. Cisco IOS images that do not include CSCee83237 are not vulnerable  to this issue.

 It is important to note that this condition cannot be  triggered by an attacker and that the condition does not provide ways to  determine the flow of traffic between VPNs.



 This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco Bug ID   CSCec12299  ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCec12299"]            ( registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only)          and has been assigned  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2008-3803.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Customers running versions of Cisco IOS that support filtering of  extended communities can prevent the corruption of the route target (RT) by  applying a BGP route-map that removes RT entries on inbound BGP  sessions.

The following configuration example applied in the ipv4  address family of a PE device removes extended communities from the CE  router:


router bgp &lt;Local AS&gt;
 address-family ipv4 vrf one  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; remote-as &lt;Remote AS&gt;  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; activate  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; route-map FILTER in  exit-address-family ! ip extcommunity-list 100 permit _RT.*_ ! ! route-map FILTER permit 10  set extcomm-list 100 delete !

The following configuration example applied in the ipv6 address family  of a PE device removes extended communities from the CE router:


router bgp &lt;Local AS&gt;
 address-family ipv6 vrf one  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; remote-as &lt;Remote AS&gt;  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; activate  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; route-map FILTER in  exit-address-family ! ip extcommunity-list 100 permit _RT.*_ ! ! route-map FILTER permit 10  set extcomm-list 100 delete !

 Note:  The capability of filtering extended communities is only available in certain 12.0S and 12.2S based Cisco IOS releases.



BGP session between the PE and the CE needs to cleared to  make this configuration change effective.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, also consult  http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"]  and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade  solution.



In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be  certain the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current  hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by  the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical  Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance.



Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) names a  Cisco IOS release train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the  earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the anticipated  date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed in the "First Fixed  Release" column of the table. The "Recommended Release" column indicates the  releases which have fixes for all the published vulnerabilities at the time of  this Advisory. A device running a release in the given train that is earlier  than the release in a specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is  known to be vulnerable. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or  later than the release in the "Recommended Releases" column of the table.

    <CVE>CVE-2008-3803</CVE>
    <Remediations>
      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>Customers running versions of Cisco IOS that support filtering of  extended communities can prevent the corruption of the route target (RT) by  applying a BGP route-map that removes RT entries on inbound BGP  sessions.

The following configuration example applied in the ipv4  address family of a PE device removes extended communities from the CE  router:


router bgp &lt;Local AS&gt;
 address-family ipv4 vrf one  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; remote-as &lt;Remote AS&gt;  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; activate  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; route-map FILTER in  exit-address-family ! ip extcommunity-list 100 permit _RT.*_ ! ! route-map FILTER permit 10  set extcomm-list 100 delete !

The following configuration example applied in the ipv6 address family  of a PE device removes extended communities from the CE router:


router bgp &lt;Local AS&gt;
 address-family ipv6 vrf one  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; remote-as &lt;Remote AS&gt;  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; activate  neighbor &lt;neighbor IP&gt; route-map FILTER in  exit-address-family ! ip extcommunity-list 100 permit _RT.*_ ! ! route-map FILTER permit 10  set extcomm-list 100 delete !

 Note:  The capability of filtering extended communities is only available in certain 12.0S and 12.2S based Cisco IOS releases.



BGP session between the PE and the CE needs to cleared to  make this configuration change effective.</Description>
