    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the SSH connection handling of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) for Cisco UCS B-Series, UCS C-Series, UCS S-Series, and UCS X-Series Servers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access internal services with elevated privileges.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on access to internal services. An attacker with a valid user account could exploit this vulnerability by using crafted syntax when connecting to the Cisco IMC of an affected device through SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access internal services with elevated privileges, which may allow unauthorized modifications to the system, including the possibility of creating new administrator accounts on the affected device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability, but a mitigation is available.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucs-ssh-priv-esc-2mZDtdjM ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucs-ssh-priv-esc-2mZDtdjM"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable software release and they accept incoming SSH connections to the Cisco IMC:

UCS B-Series Blade Servers (CSCwk24502 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk24502"])
UCS C-Series Rack Servers (CSCwc06871 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc06871"])

UCS X-Series Modular System (CSCwk24502 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk24502"])

Note: Cisco UCS C-Series and UCS S-Series Servers in standalone mode accept incoming SSH connections by default. For additional details, see the Configuring SSH section of the Cisco UCS C-Series Integrated Management Controller GUI Configuration Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/c/sw/gui/config/guide/4_3/b_cisco_ucs_c-series_gui_configuration_guide_43/b_Cisco_UCS_C-series_GUI_Configuration_Guide_41_chapter_01101.html#task_083E4199DCF1404486FC1C6F958CBE8C"]. Cisco UCS B-Series, Managed UCS C-Series, Managed UCS S-Series, and UCS X-Series Servers accept incoming SSH connections only if a Serial over LAN (SoL) policy is enabled on the associated Service Profile. For additional details, see the Serial over LAN Policy Settings section of the Cisco UCS Manager Server Management Guide ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/ucs-manager/GUI-User-Guides/Server-Mgmt/4-3/b_cisco_ucs_manager_server_mgmt_guide_4_3/m_server-related_policy_configuration.html#d21614e28464a1635"].

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

5000 Series Enterprise Network Compute Systems (ENCS)
Catalyst 8300 Series Edge uCPE
UCS E-Series Servers</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there is a mitigation.

If it is not required, SSH access to the Cisco IMC of an affected device may be disabled.

For Cisco UCS C-Series and UCS S-Series Servers in standalone mode, choose Admin &gt; Communication Services on the Cisco IMC web UI and uncheck the SSH Enabled option.

For Cisco UCS B-Series, Managed UCS C-Series, Managed UCS S-Series, and UCS X-Series Servers, disable the Serial over LAN (SoL) policy on the associated Service Profile (SoL access is disabled by default). From the Servers section of the Cisco UCS Manager web UI, do the following:

Choose the Service Profile in question.
Click the Change Serial over LAN Policy link under Actions in the Policies tab.
Choose the No Serial over LAN Policy option.
Click OK.

Alternatively, edit the applied Serial Over LAN Policy under Policies &gt; Serial Over LAN Policies and change the Serial over LAN State property from Enable to Disable. This would disable SoL access for all the Service Profiles that are using the SoL policy in question.

While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

The Cisco Support and Downloads page ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.

When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
