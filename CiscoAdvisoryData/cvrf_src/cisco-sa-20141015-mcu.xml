    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the network stack  of Cisco TelePresence MCU Software
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the exhaustion
of available memory which could lead to system instability and a
reload of the affected system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20141015-mcu["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20141015-mcu"]





Note: This security advisory does not provide information about
the GNU Bash Environment Variable Command Injection Vulnerability (also known as Shellshock).

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco TelePresence Infrastructure offers a wide range of products to
scale and manage the Cisco TelePresence solution. The Cisco TelePresence
Infrastructure solution includes Cisco
TelePresence MCU products which are a range of advanced MCUs, that are
designed to combine continuous presence with high-definition video and
voice quality, and Cisco TelePresence Server which connects users to a wide range of
endpoints and multivendor telepresence systems.



A vulnerability in the network stack  of Cisco TelePresence MCU Software
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the exhaustion
of available memory which could lead to system instability and a
reload of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to
insufficient sanitization of crafted TCP packets. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of crafted TCP packets
to the affected system.



This vulnerability is described in Cisco bug ID CSCtz35468["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz35468"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Identifier CVE-2014-3397.</cvrf:Note>
