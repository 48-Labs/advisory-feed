    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) polling for Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, Cisco Secure Email Gateway, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain confidential information about the underlying operating system.

This vulnerability exists because the appliances do not protect confidential information at rest in response to SNMP poll requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP poll request to the affected appliance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to discover confidential information that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the configured SNMP credentials.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-sma-wsa-snmp-inf-FqPvL8sX ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-sma-wsa-snmp-inf-FqPvL8sX"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they had SNMP enabled:

Secure Email and Web Manager
Secure Email Gateway
Secure Web Appliance

Note: SNMP is not enabled by default on these products.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
  Determine Whether SNMP Is Enabled
To determine whether SNMP is enabled on a device, connect to the device using SSH and run the snmpconfig command.

The following example shows the output of this command on a device that has SNMP configured:


ESA&gt; snmpconfig
Current SNMP settings:
Listening on interface "Management" 10.10.10.10/27 port 161.
SNMP v3: Enabled. Security level: authPriv
Authentication Protocol: SHA
[...]

The following example shows the output of this command on a device that does not have SNMP configured:


ESA&gt; snmpconfig
Current SNMP settings:
SNMP Disabled.

Note: The preceding examples show the output of this command on Cisco Secure Email Gateway. The output for the command on the other affected products is almost identical.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
      Fixed Releases
At the time of publication, the release information in the following tables was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

The left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.
        Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager Release  First Fixed Release          15.5 and earlier  15.5.2-005      16.0  16.0.0-195
         Cisco Secure Email Gateway Release  First Fixed Release          15.0 and earlier  15.0.3-002      15.5  15.5.2-018      16.0  16.0.0-050
         Cisco Secure Web Appliance Release  First Fixed Release          15.0 and earlier  15.0.1-004      15.1  Migrate to a fixed release.      15.2  15.2.1-010
In most cases, the software can be upgraded over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the web-based management interface of the appliance. To upgrade a device by using the web-based management interface, do the following:

Choose System Administration &gt; System Upgrade.
Click Upgrade Options.
Click Download and Install.
Choose a release to upgrade to.
In the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.
Click Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.

After the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.

Cisco Secure Email Cloud includes Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager devices as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting the Cisco TAC.
