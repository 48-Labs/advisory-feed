    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) contains
multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to disclose file components, and access text files on an affected device. Various components of Cisco Prime DCNM are
affected.  These vulnerabilities can be exploited independently on the same device; however, a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others.



Cisco Prime DCNM is affected by the following vulnerabilities:

    Cisco Prime DCNM Information Disclosure Vulnerability 
    Cisco Prime DCNM Remote Command Execution Vulnerabilities 
    Cisco Prime DCNM XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability 





Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are currently no workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130918-dcnm["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130918-dcnm"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following products are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:



 The vulnerabilities described in this advisory affect all versions of Cisco Prime DCNM prior to 6.2(1).</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco Prime DCNM, previously known as Cisco Data Center Network Manager, is a network management application that combines the management of Ethernet and storage networks into a single dashboard to help network and storage administrators manage and troubleshoot health and performance across different families of Cisco products that run Cisco NX-OS Software.



Cisco Prime DCNM Information Disclosure Vulnerability



The Cisco DCNM-SAN Server component of Cisco Prime DCNM contains a
vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
disclose arbitrary file contents on an affected system.



This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID
CSCue77029["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue77029"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"]
customers only) and has been assigned CVE identifier
CVE-2013-5487. 



Cisco Prime DCNM Remote Command Execution Vulnerabilities



The Cisco DCNM-SAN Server component of Cisco Prime DCNM contains two vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system that hosts the Cisco Prime DCNM application.



Commands are executed in the context of the system user for Cisco Prime DCNM running on Microsoft Windows or the root user for Cisco Prime DCNM running on Linux.



These vulnerabilities have been documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCue77035["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue77035"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and CSCue77036["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue77036"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only), and have been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-5486.





Cisco Prime DCNM XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability



Cisco Prime DCNM is affected by a
vulnerability which could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
access arbitrary text files on the underlying operating system with the
privilege of root using an XML external entity injection attack.  When processing incoming requests, XML external entity references and
injected tags can result in disclosure of information.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud80148["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud80148"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE identifier CVE-2013-5490</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this Advisory: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=30682["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=30682"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. 

All of the vulnerabilities included in this advisory are fixed in the Cisco Prime DCNM version 6.2(1) or later.
