    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The Portable Software Developer Kit (SDK) for Universal Plug-n-Play (UPnP) Devices contains a libupnp library, originally known as the Intel SDK for UPnP Devices, which is vulnerable to multiple stack-based buffer overflows when handling malicious Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) requests. This library is used in several vendor network devices, in addition to media streaming and file sharing applications. These vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 29th, 2013 in a CERT Vulnerability Note, VU#922681, which can be viewed at http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681["http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681"].



Cisco is currently evaluating products for possible exposure to these vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130129-upnp["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130129-upnp"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco is currently evaluating products for possible exposure to these UPnP vulnerabilities. Products will only be listed in the "Vulnerable Products" or "Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" sections of this advisory when a final determination about product exposure is made. Products that are not listed in either of these two sections are still being evaluated.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following products are affected by vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:

    Cisco TelePresence C Series Endpoints
    Cisco TelePresence System EX Series
    Cisco TelePresence SX20

This section will be updated when more information is available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The following products are not affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:


    Cisco TelePresence EC20
    Cisco Telepresence Touch Devices

Cisco Products based on IOS, IOS-XE, IOS-XR, and NX-OS do not use libupnp and are not affected.



The Cisco ASA Series Adaptive Security Appliance and the Firewall Services Modules (FWSM) do not use libupnp and are not affected.



This section will be updated when more information is available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">UPnP��� is an architecture that enables discovery, event notification, and control of devices on a network, independent of operating system, programming language, or physical network connection. UPnP��� is based on common Internet standards and specifications such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and XML.



The Portable SDK for UPnP Devices is affected by at least three remotely exploitable buffer overflows. These vulnerabilities can be exploited in the processing of incoming SSDP requests on UDP port 1900. CERT released the following CVE IDs to document these vulnerabilities: CVE-2012-5958, CVE-2012-5959, CVE-2012-5960, CVE-2012-5961, CVE-2012-5962, CVE-2012-5963, CVE-2012-5964, and CVE-2012-5965.



The following Cisco bug IDs are being used to track potential exposure to the UPnP issues. The bugs listed below do not confirm that a product is vulnerable, but rather that the product is under investigation by the appropriate product teams.



Registered Cisco customers can view these bugs via the Cisco Bug Toolkit: http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl["http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl"]

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">UPnP can be disabled on many devices using the Web User Interface. Instructions on how to disable UPnP are generally given in the Product Administration Guide. For example, in the "Configuring Basic Firewall Settings" section of the RV-120W Administration Guide, there is a checkbox to enable/disable UPnP. For additional information, see http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/csbr/rv110w/administration/guide/rv110w_admin.pdf#page84["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/csbr/rv110w/administration/guide/rv110w_admin.pdf#page84"].



Customers should follow basic hardening rules when configuring wireless devices, such as not allowing "Guest" access and requiring authentication credentials to login. 



Customers can also block traffic from untrusted hosts on UDP port 1900 to affected devices using infrastructure access control lists (iACLs). This protection mechanism filters and drops packets that are attempting to exploit these vulnerabilities.



Effective exploit prevention can also be provided by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance and the Firewall Services Module (FWSM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series switches and Cisco 7600 Series routers using transit access control lists (tACLs).



Cisco has released an Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) that explains how to detect and mitigate potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities. The AMB is available at:  https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28005["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28005"]

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.</cvrf:Note>
