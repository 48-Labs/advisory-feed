Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2023-20133: Cisco Webex Meetings Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in Webex Events (classic) programs, email templates, and survey questions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwe38545 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe38545"]
CVE ID: CVE-2023-20133
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 5.4
CVSS Vector:CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2023-20180: Cisco Webex Meetings Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack against a user.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions in the context of the affected interface with the privileges of the targeted user. These actions could include joining meetings or assistance sessions, create a test, schedule a training session, and modify a meeting registration form.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
