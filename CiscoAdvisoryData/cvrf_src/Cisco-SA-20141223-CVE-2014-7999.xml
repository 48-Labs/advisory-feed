  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the local management interface of devices running Cisco Meraki firmware could allow an authenticated, remote attacker on an adjacent network to access a deprecated HTTP handler to install firmware.

An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the local management interface and installing malicious firmware, overwriting the device configuration and possibly allowing the attacker to completely compromise the device.

Cisco Meraki has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.

An attacker must access networks adjacent to the targeted system to conduct an exploit, reducing the potential for attacks. In addition, the attacker must authenticate to the device's administrative interface, further limiting the potential for exploitation.

Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Vendor announcements are unavailable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco Meraki MS, MR, and MX firmware released prior to September 24, 2014, is vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.

Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.

Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.

Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">An update that fixed this vulnerability was made available on all product types as of September 24, 2014, and this vulnerability affects only the small percentage of Meraki devices for which a customer has deliberately chosen to postpone scheduled firmware upgrades. To check the security of their firmware, customers can visit the Meraki security dashboard ["https://dashboard.meraki.com/firmware_security"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerability Policy" Type="General" Ordinal="7">To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html"]. This document also contains instructions for obtaining fixed software and receiving security vulnerability information from Cisco.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Exploitation and Public Announcements" Type="General" Ordinal="8">The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
