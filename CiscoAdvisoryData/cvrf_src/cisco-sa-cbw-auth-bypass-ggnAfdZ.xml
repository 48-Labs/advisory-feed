    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the social login configuration option for the guest users of Cisco Business Wireless Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass social login authentication.

This vulnerability is due to a logic error with the social login implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the Guest Portal without authentication.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cbw-auth-bypass-ggnAfdZ ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cbw-auth-bypass-ggnAfdZ"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco Business Wireless AP Software and had the social login for guest users feature enabled:

Business 140AC APs
Business 141ACM Mesh Extenders
Business 142ACM Mesh Extenders
Business 143ACM Mesh Extenders
Business 145AC APs
Business 150AX APs
Business 151AXM Mesh Extenders
Business 240AC APs

Note: For Cisco Business 150 AX APs and 151 AXM Mesh Extenders, the social login feature was temporarily removed in the 10.3.2 release train. In the 10.4.2 release train, the feature was added back and this vulnerability is fixed.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

Determine the Device Configuration

To check the configuration of the primary Cisco Business Wireless AP, complete the following steps in the web UI:

Choose Wireless Settings &gt; WLANs &gt; WLAN/RLAN.
Choose General &gt; WLAN Security.
Check the Guest Network and Access Type settings.

If the Guest Network button is Enabled and Access Type is set to Social Login, the device is affected by this vulnerability.

For additional information on this configuration, see Cisco Business Access Point Administration Guide, Version 10.7.1.0 : Social Login for Guest Users ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/access_point/csbap/CBW_Admin/Admin/en_US/b_Cisco_AP_Admin_Guide.pdf"].</cvrf:Note>
