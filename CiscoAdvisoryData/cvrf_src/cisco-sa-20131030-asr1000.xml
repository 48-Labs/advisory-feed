Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could cause an affected device to reload when processing malformed ICMP error packets that belong to a TCP or UDP connection that is inspected by a Zone-Based Firewall (ZBFW). The ZBFW is not enabled by default.

To verify if a ZBFW is configured on a device, use the show policy-map type inspect zone-pair privileged EXEC command. The presence of Match: protocol tcp or Match: protocol udp and Inspect under the configured zone pair class map in the output of show policy-map type inspect zone-pair indicates that the ZBFW inspection for TCP or UDP protocols is configured.

The following output is for show policy-map type inspect zone-pair on Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured as a ZBFW:
Router#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair
  Zone-pair: clients-servers
  Service-policy inspect : clients-servers-policy

    Class-map: L4-inspect-class (match-any)
      Match: protocol tcp
      Match: protocol udp
      Match: protocol icmp
      Inspect
      &lt;output suppressed&gt;

    Note: Cisco IOS devices configured with a ZBFW are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco IOS XE Software PPTP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) packets that undergo Network Address Translation (NAT) and PPTP application layer gateway (ALG) inspection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of PPTP packets to traverse a device that is configured for NAT.

Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability if NAT and PPTP ALG are enabled on an affected device; these services are not enabled by default.

PPTP ALG is enabled on a device when NAT is enabled.

To determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the ip nat inside or ip nat outside commands must be present in different interfaces and at least one ip nat global configuration command must be present in the configuration.

The show running-config | include ip nat command can be used to determine whether NAT is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:

asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat
 ip nat inside
 ip nat outside
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1


If the output is empty, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on a given device is not vulnerable. If the output returned is not empty, PPTP ALG services may be explicitly disabled in the NAT configuration. To determine whether PPTP ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration, use the show run | include ip nat privileged EXEC command. The presence of no ip nat service pptp in the output of show run | include ip nat indicates that PPTP ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration.

The following is the output of show run | include ip nat in Cisco IOS XE Software that has the PPTP ALG disabled under NAT configuration:


      asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat
       ip nat inside
       ip nat outside
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
       no ip nat service pptp

Note: A configuration command to disable PPTP ALG in the NAT configuration is available in Cisco IOS XE Software versions 3.9 and above. On Cisco IOS XE Software versions prior to 3.9, there is no capability to disable PPTP ALG in the NAT configuration.

Cisco IOS devices configured for PPTP ALG inspection are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco IOS XE Software TCP Segment Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerability

Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing segmented TCP packets that undergo Network Address Translation (NAT). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending TCP packets that are large after the segment reassembly is complete when these packets traverse a device that is configured for NAT.

TCP reassembly is enabled when NAT is enabled.

To determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the ip nat inside or ip nat outside commands must be present in different interfaces and at least one ip nat global configuration command must be present in the configuration.

The show running-config | include ip nat command can be used to determine whether NAT is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:

asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat
 ip nat inside
 ip nat outside
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1


Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with embedded services processor 100 (ASR1000-ESP100) and Cisco ASR1002-X Series Routers are affected by this vulnerability.

To determine whether a Cisco ASR 1000 device has ASR1000-ESP100 installed or is a Cisco ASR1002-X Series Router, administrators can issue the show inventory command. The following is the output of the show inventory in Cisco IOS XE Software running on a Cisco ASR 1006 Router with ASR1000-ESP100:



asr1006#show inventory   NAME: "Chassis", DESCR: "Cisco ASR1006 Chassis"  PID: ASR1006            NAME: "module F1", DESCR: "Cisco ASR1000 Embedded Services Processor, 10 0Gbps"  PID: ASR1000-ESP10 0      &lt;output suppressed&gt;

Note: Cisco IOS devices configured for NAT are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.

  Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed EoGRE Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability


Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing malformed IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6) Ethernet over Generic Routing Encapsulation (EoGRE) packets on an interface configured with EoGRE.
EoGRE is not enabled by default.

  To determine whether EoGRE has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the tunnel mode ethernet gre ipv4 or tunnel mode ethernet gre ipv6 commands must be present on a tunnel interface configuration and at least one IP address must be configured on that interface.

The show running-config | include Tunnel|(tunnel mode|ip address .)  command can be used to determine whether EoGRE is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:

asr1004#show running-config | include Tunnel|(tunnel mode|ip address .)
interface Tunnel0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 tunnel mode ethernet gre ipv4

Note: Cisco IOS devices configured for EoGRE are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.

Determine the Running Software Version  The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS XE releases correspond to the Cisco IOS Software releases. For example, Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.2S is the software release for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS Release 15.2(2)S2.
For more information about mappings between the Cisco IOS XE releases and their associated Cisco IOS releases, see the following:

 ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_intro.html"]
To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS XE Software is running on a device, administrators can issue the show version command. The following example shows Cisco IOS XE Software that is running IOS XE Software version 3.6.2S, which maps to Cisco IOS Software version 15.2(2)S2:

asr1004#show version
Cisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.2(2)S2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)
