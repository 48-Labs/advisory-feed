    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the authorization code of the Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) could allow an authenticated but unprivileged, local attacker to delete, modify, or view the configuration of any other context of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization safeguards of certain administrative commands in a user context when the affected system is configured for multiple context mode. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing certain commands in any of the user contexts of the affected system.
