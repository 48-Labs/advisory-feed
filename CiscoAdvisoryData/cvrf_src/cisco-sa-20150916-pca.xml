    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Software contains the following vulnerabilities:


    Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Web Framework Access Controls Bypass Vulnerability
    Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Information Disclosure Vulnerability
    Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Session ID Privilege Escalation Vulnerability 



Successful exploitation of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Web Framework Access Controls Bypass Vulnerability and Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Session ID Privilege Escalation Vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to perform tasks with the privileges of an administrator for any domain or customer managed by the affected system.



Successful exploitation of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Information Disclosure Vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to access sensitive information, such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community strings and administrative credentials, of any devices imported in the system database.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Web Framework Access Controls Bypass Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Prime Collaboration
Assurance  could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to access higher-privileged functions.



The
vulnerability is due to improper implementation of authorization and
access controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
a crafted URL to the system. The attacker would need to be logged in to
the system to exploit this vulnerability.



An exploit could
allow the attacker to access functions, some of which should be accessible only
to users who have administrative privileges.
Because of this vulnerability, an attacker could create an
additional administrative user or access information from another domain if the
system is used in multiple tenants environment.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCus62671["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus62671"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and CSCus62652["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus62652"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-4304



Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Information Disclosure Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Prime Collaboration
Assurance   could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access
information about any device imported into the system database.



The
vulnerability is due to improper implementation of authorization and
access controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
crafted URLs to the system. The attacker would need to be logged in to
the system to exploit this vulnerability. 



An exploit could
allow the attacker to access information about devices imported into the
system database, including devices for other customers or domains.
The information that an attacker could retrieve includes SNMP
community strings and devices' administrative credentials. This would allow the attacker to gain administrative access to these devices.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCus62656["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus62656"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and CVE ID CVE-2015-4305.



Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Session ID Privilege Escalation Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Prime Collaboration
Assurance   could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access
information about users who are logged in to the system, including users' session identifiers.



The vulnerability is due to improper
implementation of authorization and access controls. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs to the system. The
attacker would need to be logged in to the system to exploit
this vulnerability. 



An exploit could allow the attacker to access
information about users who are logged in to the system, including users' session identifiers. Using this identifier, an attacker could
impersonate any user, including administrative users, for any domain or
customer if the system is configured for multiple tenants.
Using this information, an attacker could perform any privileged
functions during the time the session ID is valid.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCus88343["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus88343"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and CSCus88334["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus88334"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and CVE ID CVE-2015-4306.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. 

The Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Web Framework Access Controls Bypass Vulnerability, Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Information Disclosure Vulnerability, and Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Session ID Privilege Escalation Vulnerability have been fixed in Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Software Release 10.5.1 MSP patch cpc-assurance-patchbundle-10.5.1.53684-1.x86_64.tar.gz and Release 11.0 and later. There is currently no fixed release for Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Software Release 10.6 or Release 10.5 ENT.
