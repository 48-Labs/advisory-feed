    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The Smart Install client feature in Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

Affected devices that are configured as Smart Install clients are vulnerable.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds for devices that have the Smart Install client feature enabled.

This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130327-smartinstall ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130327-smartinstall"]

Note: The March 27, 2013, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the March 2013 bundled publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar13.html ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar13.html"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco devices that have affected Cisco IOS Software with the Smart Install client feature enabled are vulnerable.

To determine if a Cisco IOS device is configured with the Smart Install client feature enabled, use the show vstack config privileged EXEC command on the Smart Install client. The following is the output of the show vstack config command in a Cisco Catalyst Switch configured as a Smart Install client:

switch#show vstack config     Role: Client  Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.100
Note: Smart Install client functionality is enabled by default on Cisco IOS switches.

Note: Cisco devices that are configured as a Smart Install director are not affected by this vulnerability. The Role: Client in the output from the show vstack config command, confirms the feature is enabled on the device.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

Router&gt; show version
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Smart Install client feature in Cisco IOS Software is a plug-and-play configuration and image-management feature that provides zero-touch deployment for new switches. The feature allows a customer to ship a Cisco switch to any location, install it in the network, and power it on without additional configuration requirements.

The Smart Install client feature in Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The Smart Install client feature uses TCP port 4786 for communication. An established TCP connection with a successful TCP three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of image list parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Smart Install packets to TCP port 4786. A successful exploit could cause a Cisco Catalyst switch to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub55790 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub55790"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only), and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1146.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability other than disabling the Smart Install feature. The Smart Install Feature is enabled by default on client switches. No configuration is needed in the client switches.

In certain versions of Cisco IOS Software, the Smart Install client feature can be disabled with the global configuration command no vstack. In certain versions of Cisco IOS Software where the command is available, the vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the Smart Install client feature.

The following is the output of the show vstack config command in a Cisco Catalyst Switch with Smart Install client feature disabled:

switch#show vstack config     Role: Client (SmartInstall disabled)    Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.100

Note: The no vstack global configuration command to disable the Smart Install client feature was introduced with the fix for Cisco bug CSCtj75729 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj75729"] ("Ability to shut Smart Install default service on TCP port 4786"). If a Cisco IOS Software release supports the Smart Install client feature but the no vstack command does not exist, the release does not contain the fix for Cisco bug CSCtj75729 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj75729"].

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document "Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco IOS Software Smart Install Denial of Service Vulnerability," which is available at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28655 ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28655"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Cisco IOS Software
Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.

The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases. This tool is available on the Cisco Security (SIO) portal at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x"]

      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability other than disabling the Smart Install feature. The Smart Install Feature is enabled by default on client switches. No configuration is needed in the client switches.

In certain versions of Cisco IOS Software, the Smart Install client feature can be disabled with the global configuration command no vstack. In certain versions of Cisco IOS Software where the command is available, the vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the Smart Install client feature.

The following is the output of the show vstack config command in a Cisco Catalyst Switch with Smart Install client feature disabled:

switch#show vstack config     Role: Client (SmartInstall disabled)    Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.100

Note: The no vstack global configuration command to disable the Smart Install client feature was introduced with the fix for Cisco bug CSCtj75729 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj75729"] ("Ability to shut Smart Install default service on TCP port 4786"). If a Cisco IOS Software release supports the Smart Install client feature but the no vstack command does not exist, the release does not contain the fix for Cisco bug CSCtj75729 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj75729"].

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document "Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco IOS Software Smart Install Denial of Service Vulnerability," which is available at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28655 ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28655"].</Description>
