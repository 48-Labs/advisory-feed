    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Out-of-Band Access Point (AP) Image Download, the Clean Air Spectral Recording, and the client debug bundles features of Cisco IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected system.

This vulnerability is due to the presence of a hard-coded JSON Web Token (JWT) on an affected system.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS requests to the AP file upload interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files, perform path traversal, and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-file-uplpd-rHZG9UfC ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-file-uplpd-rHZG9UfC"]

This advisory is part of the May 2025 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are two mitigations that are preferred for addressing this vulnerability for the two possible device configurations:
  Impacted Features Not in Use
If the impacted features are not used, apply infrastructure access control lists (iACLs) to all interfaces and block the interface completely, as shown in the following example. This will completely mitigate the vulnerability.

wlc# show ap file-transfer https summary
Configured port : 8443  Operational port : 8443    wlc# show ip access-lists CVE-2025-20188    10 deny tcp any any eq 8443    20 permit ip any any
  Impacted Features in Use
If the impacted features are used, to reduce the attack surface, apply iACLs to limit the AP file upload interface to the WLC to allow traffic from expected sources only. The following is an iACL example that can be included as part of the deployed iACL:

wlc# show ap file-transfer https summary
Configured port : 8443  Operational port : 8443    wlc# show ip access-lists CVE-2025-20188    10 deny tcp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD eq 8443    20 permit ip any any

For more guidelines and recommendations for deployment techniques for iACLs, see the white paper Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/43920-iacl.html"].

There is also a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.

Manually triggering the AP client debug bundle once, as shown in the following example, will protect all affected features that use the AP file upload interface. Note that this workaround does not persist through reload and must be done any time the device is reloaded.

! Check and pick any one client in any AP associated with this WLC
wlc# show wireless client summary  Number of Clients: 1    MAC Address       AP Name                Type ID   State   Protocol   Method   Role           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  5eef.1000.0001    AP5EEF.1000.0003       WLAN 1    Run     11n(5)     None     Local             Number of Excluded Clients: 0    !

While these workarounds and mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

The Cisco Support and Downloads page ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.

When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
