    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the web-based management process on the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker must have valid administrator credentials.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the web-based management process to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-rcedos-7HjP74jD ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-rcedos-7HjP74jD"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products:

RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers
RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Routers
RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers
RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit POE VPN Routers

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

Determine the Device Configuration

The web-based management interface of these devices is available through a local LAN connection, which cannot be disabled, or through the WAN connection if the remote management feature is enabled. By default, the remote management feature is disabled on these devices.

To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled on a device, open the web-based management interface and choose Basic Settings &gt; Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled on the device.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

RV160 VPN Routers
RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Routers
RV260 VPN Routers
RV260P VPN Routers with PoE
RV260W Wireless-AC VPN Routers</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release.
