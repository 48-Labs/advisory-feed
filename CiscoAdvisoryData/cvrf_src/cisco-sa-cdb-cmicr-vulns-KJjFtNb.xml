Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2022-20731: Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches Boot Loader Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the boot loader of Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker with level 15 privileges or an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to an affected device to execute persistent code at boot time and break the chain of trust.

This vulnerability exists because Secure Boot is not properly enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code on the underlying operating system.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCvz34674 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz34674"]
CVE ID: CVE-2022-20731
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 6.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2022-20661: Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst Micro Switches Permanent Denial of Service Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the boot loader of Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst Micro Switches could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to an affected device to permanently prevent the device from booting, resulting in a permanent denial of service (DoS) condition.

This vulnerability exists because the affected devices have an internal Cisco development boot loader that includes capabilities beyond those present in a normal boot loader. An attacker with physical access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by causing the device to reboot, breaking into the ROM monitor (ROMMON) during the boot cycle, and then executing specific commands at the ROMMON prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to irrecoverably corrupt the boot ROM in such a way that the device will be unable to boot correctly during the next boot cycle. The device will continue to operate normally until it is reloaded or power-cycled.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu"] that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

The Cisco Support and Downloads page ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.
