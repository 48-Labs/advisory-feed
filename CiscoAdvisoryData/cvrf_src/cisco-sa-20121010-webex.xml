    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) player contains six buffer overflow vulnerabilities. In some cases, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of a targeted user. 



The Cisco WebEx WRF Player is an application used to play back WRF WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The Cisco WebEx WRF Player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. The Cisco WebEx WRF Player can also be manually installed for offline playback after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html["http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"].



If the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the Cisco WebEx WRF Player after downloading the latest version from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html["http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"].



Cisco has updated affected versions of the WebEx meeting sites and Cisco WebEx WRF Player to address these vulnerabilities. 



This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20121010-webex["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20121010-webex"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2"></cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx WRF Player. The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS 27 and WBS 28) are affected by at least one of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:


    T28 client builds prior to T28.4 (28.4)
    T27 client builds prior to T27LDSP32EP10 (27.32.10)

To determine the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and navigate to the Support &gt; Downloads section via the links on the left side of the page. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page. Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.10 is fixed, build 27.32.11 will also contain the software update. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, such as T27 SP32 EP10. Such an example indicates that the server is running client build 27.32.10.




Note: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">The WebEx meeting service is a hosted multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The WRF file format is used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The Cisco WebEx WRF Player is the application used to play back and edit WebEx WRF recording files, which use the .wrf extension. The Cisco WebEx WRF Player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for stream playback mode). The Cisco WebEx WRF Player can also be manually installed after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html["http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"] to play back recording files locally (for offline playback mode).

            CSCtz72850
        
    




Exploitation of the vulnerabilities may cause the Cisco WebEx WRF Player application to crash or, in some cases, result in remote code execution.



To exploit one of these vulnerabilities, the Cisco WebEx WRF Player application must open a malicious WRF file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file directly to users (for example, by using e-mail) or by directing a user to a malicious web page. Users who are attending a WebEx meeting cannot trigger the vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">While there are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities detailed in this advisory, it is possible to remove all WebEx software completely from a system using the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows users) or Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller (for Apple Mac users) available at http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html["http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html"]. Removal of WebEx software from a Linux or UNIX-based system can be accomplished by following the steps in the WebEx knowledge base help article at the following link: https://support.webex.com/MyAccountWeb/knowledgeBase.do?root=Tools&amp;parent=Knowledge&amp;articleId=WBX28548&amp;txtSearchQuery=uninstall%20linux#["https://support.webex.com/MyAccountWeb/knowledgeBase.do?root=Tools&amp;parent=Knowledge&amp;articleId=WBX28548&amp;txtSearchQuery=uninstall%20linux#"].

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance providers. 



The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS 27 and WBS 28) correct the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:


    Client builds 28.4 (T28.4)
    Client builds 27.32.10 (T27LDSP32EP10)

Client builds prior to T27 SP32 have reached end of support; to obtain fixed software please upgrade to the latest version.

To determine the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and navigate to the Support &gt; Downloads section via the links on the left side of the page. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page. Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.10 is fixed, build 27.32.11 will also contain the software update.

The Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the Cisco WebEx WRF Player are all affected. If the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was manually installed, users must download the latest version from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html["http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"] and install it. 

Users can determine whether a Cisco WebEx WRF Player is affected by these vulnerabilities by manually verifying the installed version. To do so, users can examine the file version and determine whether it contains the fixed code.

Microsoft Windows

Five dynamic link libraries (DLLs) were updated on the Microsoft Windows platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
