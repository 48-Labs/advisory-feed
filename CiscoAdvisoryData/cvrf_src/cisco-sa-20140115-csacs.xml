    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) is affected by the following vulnerabilities:

    Cisco Secure ACS RMI Privilege Escalation Vulernability
    Cisco Secure ACS RMI Unauthenticated User Access Vulnerability
Cisco Secure ACS Operating System Command Injection Vulnerability

Cisco Secure ACS uses the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) interface for internode communication using TCP ports 2020 and 2030.

  These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140115-csacs ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140115-csacs"]

Network-based mitigations for the RMI-based vulnerabilities are outlined in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating the Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Secure Access Control System
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=32120 ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=32120"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All releases  of Cisco Secure ACS prior to  release 5.5 are affected by the RMI-based vulnerabilities in this advisory.

All releases of Cisco Secure ACS prior to ACS 5.4 patch 3 are affected by the OS command injection vulnerability in this advisory.
Use the following methods to determine the version of Cisco Secure ACS that is running:

      From the Cisco Secure ACS command-line interface (CLI), issue the      show version command, as shown in the following      example:
acs51a/admin# show version
  Cisco Application Deployment Engine OS Release: 1.2  ADE-OS Build Version: 1.2.0.152  ADE-OS System Architecture: i386    Copyright (c) 2005-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.  All rights reserved.  Hostname: acs51a      Version information of installed applications  ---------------------------------------------       Cisco ACS VERSION INFORMATION  -----------------------------  Version : 5.1.0.44.6  Internal Build ID : B.2347  Patches :   5-1-0-44-3  5-1-0-44-6    acs51a/admin#

      On the main login page of the Cisco Secure ACS web-based interface,      the version information is displayed on the left side of the screen.
      From the Cisco Secure ACS web-based interface, log in and click the      About link at the top right corner of the screen.

Cisco Secure ACS version 5.1 will identify itself as version  5.1.0.44, Cisco Secure ACS version 5.2 will identify  itself as version 5.2.0.26 and Cisco Secure ACS version 5.3 will identify  itself as version 5.3.0.40. The presence of an additional  digit after the version number indicates the highest patch level installed. For  example, a version number of 5.1.0.44.3 indicates Cisco Secure  ACS version 5.1 with up to patch 3 installed. The absence of any additional  digit after the version string indicates a Cisco Secure ACS version with no  patches installed. The example above shows a Cisco Secure ACS running version 5.1 Patch 6.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following Cisco Secure Access Control Server products are not affected by this vulnerabilities:


Cisco Secure Access Control Server for Windows
Cisco Secure Access Control Server Express
Cisco Secure Access Control Server View
Cisco Secure Access Control Server Solution Engine
  No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">A core component of the Cisco TrustSec solution, Cisco Secure ACS is a highly sophisticated policy platform providing RADIUS and TACACS+ services. It supports the increasingly complex policies needed to meet today's new demands for access control management and compliance. Cisco Secure ACS provides central management of access policies for device administration and wireless, wired 802.1x, and remote VPN network access scenarios. The identity stores can be internal or external. An internal identity store has user credential information stored in an internal database. With an external identity store, Cisco Secure ACS will retrieve information from an external database.

Cisco Secure ACS RMI Privilege Escalation Vulernability

A vulnerability in the RMI interface of Cisco Secure ACS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform actions as superadmin.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the ACS via the RMI interface using an authenticated user account. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform superadmin functions via RMI.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud75180 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud75180"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0649.

Cisco Secure ACS RMI Unauthenticated User Access Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the RMI interface of Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the ACS via the RMI interface.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication and authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the ACS via the RMI interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to access the ACS and perform administrative actions.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud75187 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud75187"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0648.

The RMI interface transports data over TCP port 2020 and TCP port 2030. The RMI interface is utilized for communication between Cisco ACS nodes in a distributed deployment environment.

Cisco Secure ACS Operating System Command Injection Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Secure ACS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject operating system-level commands.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting operating system commands into a specific location of the ACS web interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform operating system-level commands without shell access, impacting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue65962 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue65962"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0650.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no configuration workarounds available for these vulnerabilities.
