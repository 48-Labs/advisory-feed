Note: Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 8.0
reached the End of Software Maintenance on October 23, 2012. Customers
using Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.0(x) versions should
contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a
supported version of Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco Unified Communications Manager is the call processing component of
the Cisco IP Telephony solution that extends enterprise telephony
features and functions to packet telephony network devices, such as IP
phones, media processing devices, VoIP gateways, and multimedia
applications. Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute code remotely.



Denial of Service Vulnerabilities



Cisco Unified
Communications Manager 7.1(x) contains a vulnerability that could allow
an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition on an
affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling . An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed registration messages, resulting in a DoS condition on an
affected device. This vulnerability is documented in
Cisco bug ID CSCuf93466["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf93466"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"]
customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3459.  This vulnerability affects
only Cisco UCM versions 7.1(x).



Cisco Unified
Communications Manager 8.5(x), 8.6(x), and 9.0(x) contain a vulnerability that
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient limiting of traffic on certain
UDP ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending UDP
packets at a high rate to certain ports on an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition on the
affected device. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub85597["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub85597"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-3460. 



Cisco Unified
Communications Manager versions 8.5(x), 8.6(x) and 9.0(1) contain a
vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause a DoS condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient rate limiting of traffic on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) port. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending UDP packets at a high rate to port 5060 on an
affected device. A sustained attack could allow the attacker to cause a
DoS condition on the affected device. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub35869["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub35869"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE ID CVE-2013-3461. 



Buffer Overflow Vulnerability



Cisco
Unified Communications Manager 7.1(x), 8.5(x), 8.6(x), 9.0(x) and 9.1(x) contain a vulnerability that could
allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow on
an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by overwriting an allocated memory
buffer on an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to
corrupt data, disrupt services, or run arbitrary commands. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud54358["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud54358"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-3462.  This vulnerability affects Cisco UCM versions 7.1(x) through 9.1(1x).</cvrf:Note>
