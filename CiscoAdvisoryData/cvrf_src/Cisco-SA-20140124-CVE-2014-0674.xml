  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the configuration of the MySQL database as installed by Cisco Video Surveillance Operations Manager (VSOM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the MySQL database.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the database on a vulnerable VSOM without having to provide a password. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the attacker to be local or to control the hostname of the machine that originates a remote connection.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need to acquire access to trusted, internal networks in order to attempt to connect to a targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">
Customers are advised to consult Cisco bug ID CSCud10992["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud10992"] for the most complete list of affected product versions.</cvrf:Note>
