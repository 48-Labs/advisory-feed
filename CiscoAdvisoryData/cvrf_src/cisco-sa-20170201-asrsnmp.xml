    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) functions of Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.13.6S, 3.16.2S, or 3.17.1S could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU usage on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to an incorrect initialized variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing SNMP polling on MIBs and using only Interface Index (ifIndex) values. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU usage to 99% on an affected device and cause a DoS condition.



There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers that are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.13.6S, 3.16.2S, or 3.17.1S.




Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release



To determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS XE Software or similar text.



The following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.17.01.S:




Router&gt; show version

Cisco IOS XE Software, Version 03.17.01.S - Standard Support Release
Cisco IOS Software, ASR903 Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-UNIVERSALK9_NPE-M), Version 15.6(1)S1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)

    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause high CPU usage by the SNMP engine on an affected device. To assess CPU usage on a device, administrators can use the show process cpu sorted command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has high CPU usage by the SNMP engine, indicated in bold:


STLD1-630-03.03-ASR1000-RU38# show process cpu sorted
CPU utilization for five seconds: 100%/0%; one minute: 100%; five minutes: 100%

Exploitation of this vulnerability may also cause a %SNMP-3-INPUT_QFULL_ERR: Packet dropped due to input queue full error to occur.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">If the device console is accessible, administrators can remove the SNMP configuration to allow the CPU to recover and allow for a device upgrade to a fixed release of the software.



If the device console is not accessible, administrators can power cycle the device and either remove the SNMP configuration or prevent SNMP polling on the device to allow for a device upgrade to a fixed release of the software.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
