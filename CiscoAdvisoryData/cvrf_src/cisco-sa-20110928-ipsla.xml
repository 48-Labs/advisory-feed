    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The Cisco IOS IP Service Level Agreement (IP SLA) feature contains a  denial of service (DoS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered when  malformed UDP packets are sent to a vulnerable device. The vulnerable UDP port  numbers depend on the device configuration. Default ports are not used for the  vulnerable UDP IP SLA operation or for the UDP responder ports.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at  https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-ipsla ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-ipsla"].

  Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software  Security Advisory bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories.  Nine of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one  advisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager.  Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the  vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco  IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the September 2011  Bundled Publication.

 Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response:  Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the  following link:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable when  they are configured for IP SLA, either as responders or as originators of  vulnerable IP SLA operations.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco  product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the  show version command to display the system banner.  The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by  displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or  "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by  "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not  have the show version command or may provide  different output.

The following example shows output from a device that runs a Cisco IOS  Software image:


Router&gt; show version

Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming  conventions is available in the white paper Cisco IOS and NX-OS  Software Reference Guide available at:    http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">IP SLA is an embedded agent in Cisco IOS Software designed to measure  and monitor common network performance metrics like jitter, latency (delay),  and packet loss.

The vulnerability that is described in this document is triggered by  malformed IP SLA packets sent to the  vulnerable device and port. A vulnerable device can be an IP SLA responder or  the source device of a vulnerable IP SLA operation.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID    CSCtk67073   ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtk67073"]  (  registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only)  and has been assigned  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-3272.
  Vulnerable IP SLA Responder Configurations
A device configured either as an IP SLA general responder or a  permanent IP SLA UDP responder is vulnerable.

The general responder processes IP SLA control protocol packets on UDP  port 1967 and then may dynamically open vulnerable UDP ports according to the  IP SLA operations requested using the control protocol. The configuration for a  general responder is as follows:


ip sla responder


The IP SLA UDP permanent responder is also vulnerable. An example  configuration is as follows:


ip sla responder udp-echo port 300

There is no default UDP port number for the UDP permanent responder

Alternatively, both the general responder and the permanent responder  can be identified with the show ip sla responder  command. The  general responder is vulnerable when it has been enabled. The permanent  responder is vulnerable only when it has been enabled and the "udpEcho  Responder" is present. In the Following example, the general responder is not  vulnerable because it has not been enabled but the permanent responder is  vulnerable because it has been enabled with a UDP echo responder:


Router# show ip sla responder
        General IP SLA Responder on Control port 1967  General IP SLA Responder is: Disabled            Permanent Port IP SLA Responder  Permanent Port IP SLA Responder is: Enabled    udpEcho Responder:     IP Address             Port    0.0.0.0                 300
    Vulnerable IP SLA Source Device Configurations
An IP SLA source device is a Cisco IOS device that has at least one IP  SLA operation configured. To be vulnerable a probe originator needs to have at  least one scheduled probe that uses either of the following IP SLA  operations:

      udp-jitter probe
      udp-echo

A vulnerable IP SLA source device configuration includes all the  following commands:

      An ip sla global configuration command to define an      IP SLA operation
      Either a udp-echo or a udp-jitter      IP SLA configuration command
      An  ip sla schedule global configuration command      that activates one of the probes that uses a vulnerable IP SLA operation

The following examples show a source device that is configured for IP  SLA UDP echo and UDP jitter probes:


ip sla 201
 udp-echo 192.168.134.21 201  ip sla schedule 201 start-time now    ip sla 301   udp-jitter 192.168.134.121 122  ip sla schedule 301 start-time now

The destination UDP ports for the probes need to be configured. If the  source UDP port is not configured an available port number will be used when  the probe is started. A device that originates a vulnerable operation will be  vulnerable on the source UDP ports of the probe and a responder will be  vulnerable on the destination UDP port used for the probe.

IP SLA probes can be configured using Simple Network Management  Protocol (SNMP). In that case, by default, the output of the show  running-config command will not include the IP SLA probe  configuration. The show ip sla configuration command can be  used to verify whether a probe has been configured either by the command line  or via SNMP.

Router# show ip sla configuration | include operation
Type of operation to perform: udp-jitter</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds for this vulnerability, but there are  mitigations that can be deployed on a general IP SLA responder to reduce the  exposure to this vulnerability.
  General IP SLA Responder Mitigation
For devices that are configured as general responders, a mitigation is  to restrict IP SLA control packets on UDP port 1967 that are addressed to the  vulnerable device to permit only trusted probe originators to open UDP ports  that could be exploited. This can be accomplished using techniques such as  Infrastructure Access list or Control Plane Protection.

For devices configured as general responders, mitigation techniques  that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the  Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:    https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20110928-ipsla. ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20110928-ipsla"]

 ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20110928-ipsla"]
  IP SLA Permanent Responder Mitigation
For the permanent responder, the mitigation is to filter UDP packets  addressed to the configured UDP port of each permanent responder to permit  packets from the IP addresses of trusted devices.
  IP SLA Source Devices Mitigation
For IP SLA source devices, a mitigation is to allow only UDP packets  from trusted devices (that is, devices that are the target of IP SLA  operations)</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, also consult  http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"]  and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade  solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be  certain the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current  hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by  the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical  Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance.

Additionally, the Cisco IOS Software Checker is available on the Cisco  Cisco Security (SIO) portal at  https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x"].  It provides several features for checking which Security Advisories affect  specified versions of Cisco IOS Software.
  Cisco IOS Software
Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a  Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest  releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release For This  Advisory column.
