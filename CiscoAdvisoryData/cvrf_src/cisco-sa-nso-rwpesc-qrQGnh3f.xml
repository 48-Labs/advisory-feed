    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Crosswork Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) CLI could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, local attacker to read and write arbitrary files as root or elevate privileges to root on the underlying operating system.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nso-rwpesc-qrQGnh3f ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nso-rwpesc-qrQGnh3f"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Crosswork NSO.

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.

For more information about how Cisco Crosswork NSO is affected by each vulnerability, see the following sections.
 CVE-2024-20326
Cisco Crosswork NSO is only affected by the vulnerability that is described in CVE-2024-20326 if one or more of the following conditions are true:

The device is running an ncs.ccl CLI specification file (clispec) that has been modified.
The device is not running the installation-provided ncs.ccl clispec.
Users can execute the Cisco Crosswork NSO Network Simulator (Netsim) on the underlying operating system.

Note: If users can execute the Netsim tool, the device is affected, regardless of the clispec status.

For more information about the Netsim tool, see the Network Simulator ["https://cisco-tail-f.gitbook.io/nso-documentation/operation-and-usage/cli/network-simulator-netsim"] section of the Cisco Crosswork NSO documentation.

Determine Whether the ncs.ccl clispec Is Running on a Device

Cisco Crosswork NSO allows for customization of the default clispec (ncs.ccl). If a device is running a modified ncs.ccl clispec, if the ncs.ccl clispec has been removed, or if the ncs.ccl clispec is not configured on the device, then the device is affected.

To determine whether the ncs.ccl clispec is running on a device, use the describe ping command, as shown in the following example:


admin@ncs&gt; describe ping

Common
    Source : clispec
  File   : /opt/ncs/ncs-6.2.4/etc/ncs/ncs.ccl

Callback [os command]
.
.
.


If the command returns a Source value of clispec and a File value of &lt;nso installation dir&gt;/etc/ncs/ncs.ccl, then the device is running the ncs.ccl clispec. The ncs.ccl clispec should be checked to see if it has been modified.

If the describe ping command produces output for the Source or File values that differs from the preceding example, then the device is affected, and no further checks are required. The following example shows output from an affected device:


admin@ncs&gt; describe ping

Common
    Source : built-in

Callback [os command]
.
.
.


Determine Whether the ncs.ccl clispec Has Been Modified

To determine whether an administrator has modified the ncs.ccl clispec, calculate the hash of the ncs.cli clispec source file using the shasum -a 256 ncs.cli command from the source directory, as shown in the following example:


&lt;nso_installation_path&gt;/src/ncs/cli/ shasum -a 256 ncs.cli

1bbcf2ec885311eed22a21644cbe02c211ee45e8a4ff2be56769324534a26f0d  ncs.cli


If the returned hash value matches the preceding example exactly, then the source file has not been modified.
 CVE-2024-20389
Only Cisco Crosswork NSO releases 6.0.11 and 6.2.1 are affected by the vulnerability that is described in CVE-2024-20389. All other software releases are not affected.</cvrf:Note>
