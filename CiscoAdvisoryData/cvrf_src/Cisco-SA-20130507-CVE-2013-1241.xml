    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in authentication header packets processing on the Cisco ISM module for ISR G2 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected module.



The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed authentication header packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of malformed authentication header packets over an established IPsec security association. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected module, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition for IPsec traffic.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must authenticate to a targeted system to send malformed authentication header packets. This access requirement limits the possibility of a successful exploit.



Customers are advised to review the bug reports in the "Vendor Announcements" section for a current list of affected versions.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco has released a security notice for bug ID CSCub92025["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub92025"] at the following link: CVE-2013-1241["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityNotice/CVE-2013-1241"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">At the time this alert was first published, Cisco IOS Software Releases 15.3(200)T and prior were vulnerable. Later releases of Cisco IOS Software may also be affected.</cvrf:Note>
