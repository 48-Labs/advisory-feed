  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in an HTTP handler in Cisco Meraki firmware occurs because the handler does not require requests to come only from the Meraki cloud. This vulnerability could allow a LAN-based attacker to obtain sensitive credential information.

An unauthenticated, remote attacker on an adjacent network could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to the unsecured HTTP handler, allowing the attacker to access sensitive information from the affected application.

Cisco Meraki has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.

Attackers must have access to networks adjacent to the targeted system to conduct an exploit, reducing the potential for attacks.

Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Vendor announcements are not available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco Meraki MS, MR, and MX firmware released prior to September 24, 2014, is vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.

Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.

Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.

Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">An update that fixed this vulnerability was made available on all product types as of September 24, 2014, and this vulnerability affects only the small percentage of Meraki devices for which a customer has deliberately chosen to postpone scheduled firmware upgrades. To check the security of their firmware, customers can visit the Meraki security dashboard ["https://dashboard.meraki.com/firmware_security"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerability Policy" Type="General" Ordinal="7">To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html"]. This document also contains instructions for obtaining fixed software and receiving security vulnerability information from Cisco.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Exploitation and Public Announcements" Type="General" Ordinal="8">The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
