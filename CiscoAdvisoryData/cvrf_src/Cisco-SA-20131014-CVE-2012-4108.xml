    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the fabric interconnect of the Cisco Unified
Computing System could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute
commands on the underlying operating system.



The
vulnerability is due to improper filtering of user-supplied parameters.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing parameters to
some file-related commands. An exploit could allow the attacker to
execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system or obtain
a command shell with elevated privileges.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to authenticate and have local access to a targeted device. These access requirements decrease the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
