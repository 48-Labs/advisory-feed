Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2023-20061: Cisco Unified Intelligence Center Information Disclosure Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.

This vulnerability is due to excessive verbosity in a specific REST API output. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to to obtain sensitive data, including hashed credentials for services associated to the affected device.

Cisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwd02972
CVE ID: CVE-2023-20061
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2023-20062: Cisco Unified Intelligence Center Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass access controls and conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on an affected system.

This vulnerability is due to improper input validation for specific HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary network requests sourced from the affected system.

Cisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
