    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The firmware of Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Routers and WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Routers contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information from a targeted device.

The vulnerability is due to improper security protections on SSL certificate private keys on affected devices.  An unauthenticated, remote could exploit this vulnerability to retrieve SSL certificate key information from a targeted device.  If successful, the attacker could access sensitive information that could be used in further attacks.

Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability and has released updated software.





Unless remote management capabilities are enabled, an attacker could only exploit this vulnerability from internal networks, limiting the potential for exploitation.  Remote management is disabled by default.

Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.
