    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Server Message Block Protocol (SMB) module of Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the SMB module.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SMB Negotiate Protocol Request packet with an invalid field to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the SMB module on the device, resulting in a partial denial of service (DoS) condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to send a crafted SMB Negotiate Protocol Request packet to the device. This access requirement may limit the possibility of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.
