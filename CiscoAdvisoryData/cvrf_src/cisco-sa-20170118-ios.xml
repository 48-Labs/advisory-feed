    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOx Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view confidential information that is displayed without authenticating to the device.

 

The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input validation of the HTTP URL being requested. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to view confidential information that should only be visible to authenticated users to the device. The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.



There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
