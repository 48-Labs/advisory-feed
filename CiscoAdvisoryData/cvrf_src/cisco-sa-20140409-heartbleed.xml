  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of the OpenSSL package affected by a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve memory in chunks of 64 kilobytes from a connected client or server.



The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the handling of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) heartbeat extension. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by implementing a malicious TLS or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) client, if trying to exploit the vulnerability on an affected server, or a malicious TLS or DTLS server, if trying to exploit the vulnerability on an affected client. An exploit could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS heartbeat packet to the connected client or server. An exploit could allow the attacker to disclose a limited portion of memory from a connected client or server for every heartbeat packet sent. The disclosed portions of memory could contain sensitive information that may include private keys and passwords.



Please note that the devices that are affected by this vulnerability are the devices acting as an SSL server terminating SSL connections or devices acting as an SSL Client initiating an SSL connection. Devices that are simply traversed by SSL traffic without terminating it are not affected.



This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available. Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities may be available.

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">A vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security (TLS)/Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) heartbeat functionality in OpenSSL used in multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve memory in chunks of 64 kilobytes from a connected client or server.



The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by implementing a malicious TLS or DTLS client, if trying to exploit the vulnerability on an affected server, or a malicious TLS or DTLS server, if trying to exploit the vulnerability on an affected client. The attacker could then send a specially-crafted TLS or DTLS heartbeat packet to the connected client or server. An exploit could allow the attacker to disclose a limited portion of memory from a connected client or server for every heartbeat packet sent. The disclosed portions of memory could contain sensitive information that may include private keys and passwords.



This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-0160



The criteria used to establish whether a Cisco product or service is vulnerable is solely whether it relies on an affected version of the OpenSSL library in order to implement a TLS/DTLS client or server. The criteria does not restrict the analysis to any specific set of protocols that the client or server may implement (eg: HTTPS, SMTP, EAP, etc.).

Based on this criteria the products that are listed in this security advisory as not vulnerable are such no matter which attack vector an attacker may attempt to use to exploit Heartbleed. 



The Cupid attack exploits the Heartbleed bug using the EAP protocol as an attack vector to target the TLS layer in EAP-TLS. The products that are listed in this security advisory that are not vulnerable to the Heartbleed vulnerability are also unaffected by the Cupid attack.



The impact of this vulnerability on Cisco products may vary depending on the affected product.



Given the unique characteristics of the Heartbleed vulnerability, Cisco recommends customers to generate new public/private key pairs, obtain a new certificate for that key pair, and install the new certificate and associated key pair as appropriate on all affected deployments after installing the software updates. This is general advice appropriate for Cisco and non-Cisco devices.



For Cisco products, please refer to the information provided in the Cisco bug IDs, listed in the Affected Products section of this document. Additional information and detailed instructions on how to perform those tasks are available on the Cisco installation, configuration and maintenance guides for each product. If additional clarification or advice is needed, please contact your support organization.



Product Specific Information
Cisco Meraki


Cisco has made available additional information in the following document: https://meraki.cisco.com/blog/2014/04/openssl-and-the-heartbleed-vulnerability/["https://meraki.cisco.com/blog/2014/04/openssl-and-the-heartbleed-vulnerability/"]



Small Cell factory recovery root filesystem


The following products leverage the Small cell factory recovery root filesystem V2.99.4 or later.  The factory recovery root filesystem is not stored in flash but is downloaded from Cisco USC CloudBase and only used for the duration of the activation/recovery process. OpenSSL is called by the cURL application, which is itself called from a shell script so a malicious user would have no exposure to any Cisco proprietary code and the memory space of the cURL process would not contain any private keys:

Cisco Collaboration Systems 10.x:


Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM) version 10.0, Cisco Unity Connection (UC) version 10.0, and Cisco Unified Presence Server (CUPS) version 10.0 are affected by the OpenSSL vulnerability described in this advisory. An unauthenticated, remote attacker with the ability to open a TCP connection to an affected port may exploit the vulnerability.  Successful exploitation may allow the attacker to disclose potentially sensitive information.



Cisco voice and presence devices open a number of service ports to accept connections from users, administrators, phones, and IP voice gateways. A majority of these services are secured utilizing SSL or TLS and may be leveraged by an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.



Cisco Unified IP Phones:


Cisco Unified 7800 Series, Cisco Unified 8961, Cisco Unified 9951, and Cisco Unified 9971 IP Phones may be exposed to the vulnerability when the secure Web Management interface is enabled.  Additionally, attacks may be executed via secure SIP and secure RTP.



An unauthenticated, remote attacker with the ability to reach the Web Management interface when enabled, or that can place a direct secure SIP call to the device may trigger the vulnerability.  Successful exploitation may allow the attacker to disclose potentially sensitive information.



Voice networks that have been deployed using Cisco Secure Configuration Guidelines are at a reduced risk from outside attackers.  Phones that have been segmented from the common use network should restrict the attack surface to other phones and users who have direct access to the voice network.



Cisco Desktop Collaboration Experience:


Cisco Desktop Collaboration Experience DX650 devices may be exposed via the secure Web Management Interface when enabled.  These devices may also be exploited via secure SIP, secure RTP, as well as any other application installed on the device that utilizes the system-supplied OpenSSL library.



An unauthenticated, remote attacker with the ability to reach the Web Management interface when enabled can place a direct secure SIP call to the device, or access an affected service may trigger the vulnerability.  Successful exploitation may allow the attacker to disclose potentially sensitive information.



Voice networks that have been deployed using Cisco Secure Configuration Guidelines are at a reduced risk from outside attackers.  Phones that have been segmented from the common use network should restrict the attack surface to other phones and users who have direct access to the voice network.



Voice Networks Security Hardening Guidelines:


Cisco provides a comprehensive design guide for all voice network deployments. This includes suggested security feature configurations on intermediate and edge devices to prevent spoofed traffic from being passed on the voice network as well as the isolation and segregation of voice traffic from general network traffic. Security information for Cisco Collaboration Systems 10.x is available at the following link: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/collab10/collab10/security.html["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/collab10/collab10/security.html"]

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ERP-Heartbleed.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ERP-Heartbleed.html"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



This section will be updated when information about fixed software versions is available.



Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for iOS


Fixed in version 3.0.09353 and available for download on the App Store for devices running iOS version 6 or 7.



Cisco WebEx Meetings Server


Fixed in version 2.0MR2



Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS)


Fixed in version X7.2.3 and X8.1.1



Cisco Expressway Series


Fixed in version X8.1.1



Cisco FireAMP Private Cloud Virtual Appliance


Fixed in version 1.0.20140409



After the update:

In order to further secure the Private Cloud instance, it is recommended that customers, after having completed the software update, replace any existing certificates on the appliance:



Customers using certificates other than self-signed certificates should procure and install new certificates. Those certificates should be generated using a new private/public key pair. Customer should NOT reuse the previous public/private keypair. Once replaced, putting the device in and out of maintenance mode will ensure that the new certificates are loaded.



Customers using the default self-signed certificates should generate new certificates after performing the FireAMP Private Cloud update by executing the following commands:

amp-ctl maintenance enable
amp-ctl regenerate-ssl-certs
amp-ctl maintenance disable

This will regenerate the SSL certificates and restart all of the services.



Additionally, customers should reset all passwords (opadmin and fireamp console) and perform a review of the audit logs in both portals.

Cisco SourceFire


Cisco SourceFire 3D Appliances (running release 4.10.x and 5.x up to 5.3) and Cisco SourceFire SSL appliances are not vulnerable to this issue. These appliances run the 0.9.8 branch of OpenSSL which is not affected by this vulnerability.
