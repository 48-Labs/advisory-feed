Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2022-20699: Cisco RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers SSL VPN Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the SSL VPN module of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary checks when processing specific HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to the affected device that is acting as an SSL VPN Gateway. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code with root privileges on the affected device.

CVE-2022-20703: Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Digital Signature Verification Bypass Vulnerability


A vulnerability in the software image verification feature of Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to install and boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned binaries on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper verification of software images as they are installed on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned software on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned binaries on the device.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

CVE-2022-20704: Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers SSL Certificate Validation Vulnerability


A vulnerability in the software upgrade module of Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view or alter information that is shared between an affected device and specific Cisco servers (cloudsso.cisco.com and api.cisco.com).

This vulnerability is due to improper validation of the SSL server certificate that is received when establishing a connection to specific remote servers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using man-in-the-middle techniques to intercept the traffic between the affected device and the server, and then using a forged certificate to impersonate the server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force the affected device to download arbitrary software images and launch further attacks, combining other vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

CVE-2022-20705: Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Improper Session Management Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the session management of the web UI of Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to defeat authentication protections and access the web UI. The attacker could obtain partial administrative privileges and perform unauthorized actions.

This vulnerability is due to the use of weak entropy for session identifier generation functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability either by using brute force to determine a current session identifier and then reusing the identifier to take over an ongoing session or by crafting a new, valid session identifier and bypassing the whole authentication mechanism. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take actions within the web UI with privileges up to the level of the administrative user and launch further attacks, exploiting the other vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

CVE-2022-20706: Cisco RV Series Routers Open Plug and Play Command Injection Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the Open Plug and Play (PnP) module of Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must leverage a man-in-the-middle position or have an established foothold on a specific network device that is connected to the vulnerable router.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu"] that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

The Cisco Support and Downloads page ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.

When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"] as indicated in the following table(s):
        Cisco Product  Vulnerable Releases  First Fixed Release          RV160 and RV260 Series Routers  1.0.01.05 and earlier  1.0.01.07      RV340 and RV345 Series Routers  1.0.03.24 and earlier  1.0.03.26
