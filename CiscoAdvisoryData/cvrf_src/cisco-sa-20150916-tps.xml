    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco TelePresence Server contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Conference Control Protocol API that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. No workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150916-tps ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150916-tps"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All releases of Cisco TelePresence Server software prior to 4.1(2.33) running on the following products are affected by this vulnerability:

Cisco TelePresence Server 7010
Cisco TelePresence Server MSE 8710
Cisco TelePresence Server on Multiparty Media 310
Cisco TelePresence Server on Multiparty Media 320
Cisco TelePresence Server on Virtual Machine</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco TelePresence Server offers workers business-quality intuitive video conferencing and interoperates with Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco TelePresence Management Suite, and Cisco TelePresence Conductor.

Cisco TelePresence Server contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Conference Control Protocol API that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.

The vulnerability is likely to result in only a DoS condition due to input sanitization performed on the user-supplied data before it is copied into the affected buffer. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted URL that is designed to trigger the overflow condition.
