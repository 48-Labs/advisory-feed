    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The Catalyst 4500E series switch with Supervisor Engine 7L-E contains a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability when processing specially crafted packets that can cause a reload of the device.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 



Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.



This advisory is available at the following link: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120926-ecc["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120926-ecc"]

Note: The September 26, 2012, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes nine Cisco Security Advisories. Eight of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the September 2012 bundled publication. 

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semi-Annual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects only the Catalyst 4500E series switch with Supervisor Engine 7L-E running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 03.02.00.XO.15.0(2)XO.  The device is vulnerable when running an affected version of Cisco IOS XE Software, regardless of the configuration of the device



To identify the hardware type log into the device and issue the show module Cisco IOS XE Software CLI command. The following example shows a Catalyst 4500-E Series with a Catalyst Supervisor Engine 7L-E installed:


switch#show module
Chassis Type : WS-C4507R+E

Power consumed by backplane : 40 Watts

Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.
---+-----+--------------------------------------+------------------+-----------
 4     6  Sup 7L-E 10GE (SFP+), 1000BaseX (SFP)  WS-X45-SUP7L-E     CAT1532L4ZA
 5    48  10/100/1000BaseT (RJ45)                WS-X4448-GB-RJ45   JAB023456A3

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.



The following example identifies a Catalyst 4500E series switch with Supervisor Engine 7L-E that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 03.02.00.XO.15.0(2)XO with an installed image name of cat4500e-universal.SPA:


Catalyst_4500#show version
Cisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software, Catalyst 4500 L3 Switch Software (cat4500e-UNIVERSAL-M), Version 03.02.00.XO RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following products are affected by this vulnerability, when running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 03.02.00.XO.15.0(2)XO:


    Catalyst 4500E series switch with Supervisor Engine 7L-E
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The following products are not affected by this vulnerability:


    Cisco Catalyst Supervisor Engine II

    Cisco Catalyst Supervisor Engine 6-E and 6-LE
    Cisco Catalyst Supervisor Engine 7-E

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco Catalyst 4500E series switches with Supervisor Engine 7L-E contain a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device supervisor card to reload.



The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed network packets. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to or through the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to reload the affected device supervisor card, resulting in a DoS condition.

When the specially crafted packets are received the device will indicate an error message about an uncorrected error-correcting code (ECC) failure.  The following is an example of this error message:


%C4K_SWITCHINGENGINEMAN-4-VFEL2INTERRUPT: (Suppressed 9 times)VFE L2 sptMemory interrupt. valid: 1 addr: 0x0 data: 0x0 uncorrected ecc: 0


IF 100 of these packets have been received in a period of less than 72 hours, the device will reload.



There are also packets that would cause a similar error message but result in a corrected ECC error message.  These are informational and do not have an impact on the device itself.  The following is an example of this error message:


%C4K_SWITCHINGENGINEMAN-4-VFEL2INTERRUPT: VFE L2 sptMemory interrupt. valid: 1 addr: 0x0 data: 0x0 corrected ecc: 2
  

The device is vulnerable when running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 03.02.00.XO.15.0(2)XO, regardless of the configuration of the device.



 This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCty88456["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty88456"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4622.





</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">The are no workarounds for this vulnerability. The use of port access control lists (PACL) and VLAN access control lists (VACL) does not mitigate this vulnerability.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
