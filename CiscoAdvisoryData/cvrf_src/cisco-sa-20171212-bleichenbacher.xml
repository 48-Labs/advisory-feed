    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">On December 12, 2017, a research paper with the title Return of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat was  made publicly available. This paper describes how some Transport Layer Security (TLS) stacks are vulnerable to variations of the classic Bleichenbacher attack on RSA key exchange. Multiple vulnerabilities were identified based on this research.

An attacker could iteratively query a server running a vulnerable TLS stack implementation to perform cryptanalytic operations that may allow decryption of previously captured TLS sessions.

To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to perform both of the following actions:

Capture traffic between clients and the affected TLS server.
Actively establish a considerable number of TLS connections to the vulnerable server. The actual number of connections required varies with the implementation-specific vulnerabilities, and could range from hundreds of thousands to millions of connections.
Multiple Cisco products are affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has released software updates that address some of these vulnerabilities.

There may be workarounds available for selected products.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Bleichenbacher's attack is an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack against RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption block formatting. Daniel Bleichenbacher originally performed this attack against the RSA key exchange on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Version 3.0.

The attack relies on the presence of a side channel indicating, for any chosen ciphertext, whether the corresponding plaintext has the correct format according to the RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 standard. An attacker could exploit this side channel as an oracle, iteratively constructing crafted TLS messages. Eventually the attacker might be able to recover the plaintext for a given TLS session.

The new research focused on identifying current TLS implementations affected by the classic Bleichenbacher attack or those affected by newly introduced variations. These new variations use the overall TCP connection state as a possible side channel and use a nonstandard, abbreviated TLS message flow.

The following vulnerabilities were identified based on this research:

Cavium SSL SDK Bleichenbacher Attack Information Disclosure Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of Cavium SSL Software Development Kits (SDKs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.

The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack.

This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-17428.

  Legacy Cisco ASA 5500 Series Bleichenbacher Attack Information Disclosure Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of legacy Cisco ASA 5500 Series (ASA 5505, 5510, 5520, 5540, and 5550) devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.

The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack.

This vulnerability affects the listed ASA models when they are using a 2048-bit RSA key.

This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-12373.

SSL Visibility Bleichenbacher Attack Information Disclosure Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of Cisco SSL Appliance (Bluecoat SSL Visibility OEM appliance) could allow an  unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.

The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures  against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for  key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending  crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and  allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack.

This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-15533.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Disabling use of TLS ciphers that rely on RSA for key exchange is a possible mitigation for these vulnerabilities. It is applicable only to products that support other types of ciphers, such as those based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This mitigation may have an impact on interoperability with legacy clients that do not support these ciphers. This mitigation is not applicable to Cisco Application Control Engine (ACE).
