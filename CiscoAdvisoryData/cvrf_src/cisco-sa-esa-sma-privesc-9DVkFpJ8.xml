    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2023-20009: Cisco ESA and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web UI and CLI of Cisco ESA and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker (web UI) or authenticated, local attacker (CLI) to elevate privileges to root. The attacker must have valid user credentials with Operator-level privileges or higher.

This vulnerability is due to the improper validation of an uploaded Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) configuration file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and uploading a specially crafted SNMP configuration file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands as root.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwd29901 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd29901"], CSCwd29905 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd29905"]
CVE ID: CVE-2023-20009
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2023-20075: Cisco ESA Command Injection Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco ESA could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting operating system commands into a legitimate command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted command prompt and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the CLI process user. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid user credentials with Operator-level privileges or higher.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwd50043 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd50043"]
CVE ID: CVE-2023-20075
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 6.0
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu"] that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

The Cisco Support and Downloads page ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.

When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
      Fixed Releases
Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"] as indicated in the following tables:

In most cases, the software can be upgraded over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the web interface of the appliance. To upgrade a device by using the web interface, do the following:

Choose System Administration &gt; System Upgrade.
Click Upgrade Options.
Choose Download and Install.
Choose the release to upgrade to.
In the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.
Click Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.

After the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.

Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) includes Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager devices as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.
