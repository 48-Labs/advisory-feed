    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in TCP port management in Cisco ONS 15454 Series Multiservice Provisioning Platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the controller card to unexpectedly reload.



The vulnerability is due to a specific TCP port listening on the local management port when it should have been internal only. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a continuous stream of TCP traffic to the targeted device on the specific TCP port. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the controller card to unexpectedly reset. The user traffic is not impacted; however, the management port traffic could be briefly disrupted.



There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.
