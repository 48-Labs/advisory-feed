    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the database user.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious input to the affected function.



Proof-of-concept code that demonstrates an exploit of this vulnerability is publicly available.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security advisory; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires authenticated access to the targeted system. Authenticated access may require the attacker to access trusted, internal networks. These access requirements could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco Unified CM version 8.0 reached the End of Software Maintenance on October 23, 2012. Customers using Cisco Unified CM 8.0(x) versions should contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco Unified CM.



Cisco Unified CM is the only product confirmed to be vulnerable. Additional voice products may be affected by one or more of the individual vulnerabilities that are described in the advisory. The following products are being investigated but have not yet been confirmed as vulnerable:


     Cisco Emergency Responder
     Cisco Unified Contact Center Express
     Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal
     Cisco Unified Presence Server/Cisco IM and Presence Service
     Cisco Unity Connection
