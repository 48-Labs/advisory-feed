  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Mobile contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Cisco WAAS Mobile server with the privileges of the Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20131106-waasm["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20131106-waasm"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco WAAS Mobile server versions prior to 3.5.5 are affected by this vulnerability.



The software version of a Cisco WAAS Mobile server can be determined by first accessing the web administration interface. The software version number is located on the right side of the header.



</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following products running Cisco WAAS Software are not affected by this vulnerability:


    Cisco WAAS
    Cisco WAAS Express

Note: this vulnerability does not affect the Cisco WAAS Mobile software component installed on the clients.



No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco WAAS Mobile extends Cisco WAAS software application acceleration benefits to teleworkers, small and home office workers, and mobile employees who travel outside the branch office.



A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco WAAS Mobile server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data in the body of an HTTP POST request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP POST request  for content upload that would result in an uncontrolled directory traversal. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the WAAS Mobile server with the privileges of the IIS web server.



Note: The vulnerable component belongs to the web management interface; however, in a deployment where more than one Cisco WAAS Mobile server is used then all the servers are vulnerable, not just the one performing the Manager role and hosting the web management interface.

Note: This vulnerability does not affect the software component installed on the clients. 



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh69773["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh69773"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5554</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">This vulnerability has been fixed in Cisco WAAS Mobile version 3.5.5 and later.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
