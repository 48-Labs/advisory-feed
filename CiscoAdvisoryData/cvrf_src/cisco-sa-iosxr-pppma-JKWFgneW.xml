    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) termination feature of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to crash the ppp_ma process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of malformed PPPoE packets that are received on a router that is running Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) functionality with PPPoE termination on a Lightspeed-based or Lightspeed-Plus-based line card. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PPPoE packet to an affected line card interface that does not terminate PPPoE. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the ppp_ma process, resulting in a DoS condition for PPPoE traffic across the router.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and have all of the following characteristics:

A Lightspeed-based or Lightspeed-Plus-based line card installed
BNG with PPPoE termination enabled
At least one interface or sub-interface with PPPoE enabled on an affected line card
At least one interface or sub-interface with PPPoE not enabled on an affected line card

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.

Determine the Installed Line Cards

To determine which line cards are installed in the device, use the show platform CLI command.

The following example shows the output for a device with two Lightspeed A99-32X100GE-X-SE line cards and a Lightspeed-Plus A99-4HG-FLEX-TR line card installed:

For more information about line card type identification, see Understand ASR 9000 Series Line Card Types ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html#toc-hId-1632308981"].

Note: At the time of publication, the lists of Cisco Lightspeed and Lightspeed-Plus product identifiers (PIDs) were accurate. For specific questions and further clarification about a PID, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).

Determine Whether BNG PPPoE is Enabled Globally

To determine whether BNG PPPoE is enabled globally, use the show running-config pppoe bba-group command. If pppoe bba-group is present under the broadband aggregation (BBA) group, as shown in the following example, BNG PPPoE is enabled:


RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR-9906-D#show running-config pppoe bba-group
Thu Feb 1 21:19:21.003 UTC
pppoe bba-group TS-PPPOE
service selection disable
 sessions max limit 32000
!
RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR-9906-D#

Determine Whether BNG PPPoE is Enabled on an Interface


To determine whether an interface has BNG PPPoE enabled, use the show running-config interface | utility egrep "interface|pppoe enable bba-group|bundle id" command. If pppoe enable bba-group is configured on an interface or sub-interface, BNG PPoE is enabled.

The following example shows the output for a device that has the following characteristics:

Interface Bundle-Ether41.50 has PPPoE enabled.
Interface TenGigE0/3/0/0 is configured as part of Bundle-Ether41.
Interface TenGigE0/3/0/0 is on a Lightspeed-Plus-based line card A99-4HG-FLEX-TR and has PPPoE enabled.


RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR-9906-D#show running-config interface | utility egrep "interface|pppoe enable bba-group|bundle id"
Thu Feb 1 22:12:42.769 UTC
interface Bundle-Ether20
interface Bundle-Ether20
interface Bundle-Ether41
interface Bundle-Ether41.50

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

The Cisco Support and Downloads page ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.

When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
