    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) contains the following vulnerabilities:

Cisco ISE Authenticated Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability
Cisco ISE Support Information Download Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
  These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is  affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the  other.

Successful exploitation of Cisco ISE Authenticated Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability may allow an authenticated remote  attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system.

Successful  exploitation of Cisco ISE Support Information Download Authentication Bypass Vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain  sensitive information including administrative credentials.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.  This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20131023-ise ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20131023-ise"]

Cisco ISE Authenticated Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands and execute the affected function. An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the affected system with the privilege of the root user.

Note: This vulnerability can be exploited over the default management TCP port 443. A full three-way handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh81511 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh81511"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5530.

Cisco ISE Support Information Download Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the implementation of the authentication code that is used to validate requests to download a product support bundle could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download a full product support bundle.

The vulnerability is due to an error in the logic that is used to validate support bundle access requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable system. An exploit could allow an attacker to obtain a full copy of the product configuration or other sensitive information including administrative credentials.

Note: This vulnerability can be exploited over the default  management port TCP port 443. A full three-way handshake is needed to exploit  this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCty20405 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty20405"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5531</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that mitigate the vulnerabilities that are described in this security advisory.</cvrf:Note>
