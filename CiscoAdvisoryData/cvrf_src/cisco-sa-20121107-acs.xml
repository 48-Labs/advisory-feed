    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) contains a vulnerability that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass TACACS+ based authentication
service offered by the affected product. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the user-supplied password when TACACS+ is the authentication protocol and Cisco Secure ACS is configured with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) external identity store.



An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending a special sequence of
characters when prompted for the user password. The attacker would need to know a valid username stored in the LDAP external identity store to exploit this
vulnerability, and the exploitation is limited to impersonate only that user. An exploit could allow the attacker to successfully authenticate to any system using TACACS+ in combination with an affected Cisco Secure ACS.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20121107-acs["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20121107-acs"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2"> The following Cisco Secure ACS versions are affected by this
vulnerability:

The previous list applies to both the hardware appliance and the
software-only versions of the product.

The following methods can be used to determine which version of the
Cisco Secure ACS is installed:


    
    From the Cisco Secure ACS command-line interface (CLI), issue the
    show version command, as shown in the following
    example:

    
    acs51a/admin# show version

Cisco Application Deployment Engine OS Release: 1.2
ADE-OS Build Version: 1.2.0.152
ADE-OS System Architecture: i386

Cisco ACS VERSION INFORMATION
-----------------------------
Version : 5.1.0.44.6

    On the main login page of the Cisco Secure ACS web-based interface,
    the version information is displayed on the left side of the screen.
    
    From the Cisco Secure ACS web-based interface, log in and click the
    About link at the top right corner of the screen.

Cisco Secure ACS version 5.1 will identify itself as version
5.1.0.44, Cisco Secure ACS version 5.2 will identify
itself as version 5.2.0.26 and Cisco Secure ACS version 5.3 will identify
itself as version 5.3.0.40. The presence of an additional
digit after the version number indicates the highest patch level installed. For
example, a version number of 5.1.0.44.3 indicates Cisco Secure
ACS version 5.1 with up to patch 3 installed. The absence of any additional
digit after the version string indicates a Cisco Secure ACS version with no
patches installed. The example above shows a Cisco Secure ACS running version 5.1 Patch 6.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following Cisco Secure ACS products are not affected by this vulnerability:


    Cisco Secure Access Control Server for Windows
    Cisco Secure Access Control Server Express
    Cisco Secure Access Control Server View
    Cisco Secure Access Control Server Solution Engine

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) operates as a centralized RADIUS and TACACS+ server,
combining user authentication, user and administrator device access control,
and policy control into a centralized identity networking solution.



Cisco Secure ACS provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services to network devices and other clients by using the Cisco Secure ACS network resource repositories and identity stores. The identity stores can be internal or external. An internal identity store has user credentials information stored in an internal database. In an external identity store, Cisco Secure ACS will retrieve information from an external database.



Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) contains a vulnerability that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the TACACS+ based authentication
service offered by the affected product.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the user-supplied password when TACACS+ is as authentication protocol and Cisco
Secure ACS is configured with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) external identity store.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a special sequence
of
characters when prompted for the user password. The attacker would need to know a valid username stored in the LDAP external
identity store in order to exploit this
vulnerability, and the exploitation is limited to impersonate only that user. An exploit could allow the attacker to successfully authenticate
to any system using TACACS+ in combination with an affected Cisco Secure
ACS.



Note: Only a Cisco Secure ACS that is configured for TACACS+ authentication and uses LDAP as the external identity store is vulnerable.

A Cisco Secure ACS used for authentication service in combination with other supported protocols, such as RADIUS, or TACACS+ used in combination with an internal identity store or other external stores (for example, RADIUS Identity Server, Active Directory,
and RSA SecurID Token Server),


is not vulnerable. 



Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the  attacker to bypass the
authentication of any system that uses TACACS+ and relies on the authentication service provided by an
affected Cisco Secure ACS. However, the attacker will not be able to gain unauthorized access to the management interface of the Cisco Secure ACS.




This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc65634["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc65634"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only)

["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtl77440"]and has been assigned
the CVE identifier CVE-2012-5424.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There is no workaround for this vulnerability. If possible, disable anonymous
binding on the LDAP external identity store or use Active Directory external
identity store to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
