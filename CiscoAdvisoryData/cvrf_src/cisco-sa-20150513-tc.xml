    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software contains the following vulnerabilities:


    Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
    Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Crafted Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability 



Successful exploitation of the Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Authentication Bypass Vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass
system authentication and access the device with the privileges of the root user.



Successful
exploitation of the Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Crafted Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability  could allow an attacker to
restart several processes and possibly trigger a reload of the
affected system.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Authentication Bypass Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the authentication code of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker within the broadcast or collision domains, or with physical access to the system, to bypass authentication and obtain root user access to the affected system.



The
vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of authentication and
authorization controls for internal services. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by connecting to the affected service.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub67651["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub67651"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2174





Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Crafted Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability 



A vulnerability in the network drivers of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE
Software  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
several processes to restart and possibly reload the affected system.



The
vulnerability is due to insufficient implementation of flood controls.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IP
packets at a high rate. 



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID  CSCuj68952["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuj68952"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0722
