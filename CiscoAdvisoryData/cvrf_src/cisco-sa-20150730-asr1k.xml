    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the code handling the reassembly of fragmented IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6) packets of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the Embedded Services Processor (ESP) processing the packet.



The vulnerability is due to improper processing of crafted, fragmented packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted sequence of fragmented packets. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected platform.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.



There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">A vulnerability in the code handling the reassembly of fragmented IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6) packets of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the Embedded Services Processor (ESP) processing the packet.



The vulnerability is due to improper processing of crafted, fragmented packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted sequence of fragmented packets. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected platform.



This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 or IPv6 crafted, fragmented packets destined to the device itself. It cannot be triggered by transit traffic.



This vulnerability could be repeatedly exploited to cause an extended DoS condition.




This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtd72617["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtd72617"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only), and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-4291.

Notes




1. Cisco encourages customers migrating to a Cisco IOS XE Software train different from the one currently running on the device to select one of the Cisco IOS XE Software extended support trains including, but not limited to, Cisco IOS XE Software trains 3.4S, 3.7S, and 3.10S. Consult your support provider for the most appropriate software train to migrate to, based on the specific device hardware configuration and feature requirements.




2. No Cisco IOS XE Software trains with a major version number starting with the number 3 (such as 3.xS, 3.xSE, and 3.xSQ) are affected by the vulnerability described in this Cisco Security Advisory.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerability Policy" Type="General" Ordinal="7">To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the Security Vulnerability Policy[https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html]. This document also contains instructions for obtaining fixed software and receiving security vulnerability information from Cisco.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Exploitation and Public Announcements" Type="General" Ordinal="8">The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory. 



 Cisco PSIRT is aware of disruption for some
Cisco customers with Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers devices affected by this vulnerability. Traffic causing the disruption was isolated to a
specific source IPv4 address. Cisco has engaged the owner
of that address and determined that the traffic was sent with no
malicious intent. Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a
fixed Cisco IOS XE Software release to remediate this issue. 

This vulnerability was found internally by Cisco.
