    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the DHCP version 4 (DHCPv4) server feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a crash of the dhcpd process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

This vulnerability exists because certain DHCPv4 messages are improperly validated when they are processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DHCPv4 message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the dhcpd process. While the dhcpd process is restarting, which may take approximately two minutes, DHCPv4 server services are unavailable on the affected device. This could temporarily prevent network access to clients that join the network during that time period and rely on the DHCPv4 server of the affected device.

Notes:

Only the dhcpd process crashes and eventually restarts automatically. The router does not reload.
This vulnerability only applies to DHCPv4. DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) is not affected.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is part of the March 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75299"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco IOS XR Software if it had the DHCPv4 server feature or the DHCPv4 proxy feature enabled.

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
  Determine the DHCPv4 Configuration
To determine whether the DHCPv4 server feature or the DHCPv4 proxy feature is enabled on a device, run the show running-config dhcp ipv4 command in privileged EXEC mode on the device CLI and check for a server profile that is either directly or indirectly (through a base profile) bound to at least one interface.

The following example shows the output of the show running-config dhcp ipv4 command on a device that has the DHCPv4 server profile TEST directly bound to interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0:


dhcp ipv4
profile TEST server
.
.
.
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0 server profile TEST

The following example shows the output of the show running-config dhcp ipv4 command on a device that has the DHCPv4 server profiles DHCP_SERVER and DEFAULT_PROFILE indirectly bound to interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0 through base profile DHCP_BASE:


dhcp ipv4
profile DHCP_BASE base
match option 60 41424355 profile DHCP_SERVER server
default profile DEFAULT_PROFILE server
.
.
.
!
profile DHCP_SERVER server
.
.
.
!
profile DEFAULT_PROFILE server
.
.
.
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0 base profile DHCP_BASE

The following example shows the output of the show running-config dhcp ipv4 command on a device that has the DHCPv4 proxy profile PROXY directly bound to interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0:


dhcp ipv4
profile PROXY proxy
helper-address vrf default 192.168.23.7 giaddr 192.168.23.11
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0 proxy profile PROXY</cvrf:Note>
