This advisory is posted at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111005-asa["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111005-asa"].



Note:  The Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) is affected by the TACACS+ authentication bypass vulnerability, SunRPC Inspection denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities and ILS inspection DoS vulnerability. A separate Cisco Security Advisory has been published to disclose the vulnerabilities that affect the FWSM. This advisory is available at: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110831-fwsm.shtml["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111005-fwsm"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. Affected versions of Cisco ASA Software will vary depending on the specific vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">
For specific version information, refer to the Software Versions and Fixes section of this advisory.

MSN IM Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
The MSN IM inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances is affected by a DoS vulnerability.

MSN IM inspection is not enabled by default.

Administrators can enable MSN IM inspection and specify actions when a message violates a parameter, create an IM inspection policy map. You can then apply the inspection policy map when you enable IM inspection, as shown in the following example:


policy-map type inspect im MY-MSN-INSPECT
 parameters
 match protocol msn-im 
  log
!
policy-map global_policy
  class inspection_default
    inspect im MY-MSN-INSPECT

TACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
An authentication bypass vulnerability affects the TACACS+ implementation of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.

In order to enable TACACS+ for authentication, authorization, or accounting (AAA), you must first create at least one AAA server group per AAA protocol and add one or more servers to each group with the aaa-server command. You identify AAA server groups by name. The following example shows how a AAA server group is configured for TACACS+ authentication:


aaa-server my-tacacs-sever protocol tacacs+     
aaa-server my-tacacs-server (inside) host 203.0.113.11 


SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
Four DoS vulnerabilities affect the SunRPC inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.

SunRPC inspection is enabled by default.

To check if SunRPC inspection is enabled, issue the show service-policy | include sunrpc command and confirm that output, such as what is displayed in the following example, is returned.


ciscoasa# show service-policy | include sunrpc
      Inspect: sunrpc, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0

The following configuration commands are used to enable SunRPC inspection in the Cisco ASA.


class-map inspection_default
 match default-inspection-traffic
!
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  ...
  inspect sunrpc 
  ...
!
service-policy global_policy global

ILS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
A DoS vulnerability affects the ILS inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.

ILS inspection is not enabled by default.

To check if ILS inspection is enabled, issue the show service-policy | include ils command and confirm that output, such as what is displayed in the following example, is returned.


ciscoasa# show service-policy | include ils
      Inspect: ils, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0

The following configuration commands are used to enable ILS inspection in the Cisco ASA.


class-map inspection_default
 match default-inspection-traffic
!
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  ...
  inspect ils
  ...
!
service-policy global_policy global

How to Determine the Running Software Version
To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the show version command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance that is running software version 8.4(1):


ASA#show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) 
Device Manager Version 6.4(1)

Customers who use Cisco ASDM to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">
Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module are affected by the following vulnerabilities:


MSN IM Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
The IM inspect engine lets you apply fine grained controls on the IM application to control the network usage and stop leakage of confidential data, propagation of worms, and other threats to the corporate network.

A DoS vulnerability affects the MSN IM inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. During successful exploitation, an unauthenticated attacker could cause the affected device to reload and may result in a sustained DoS condition.

Note:  Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability; traffic that is destined to the appliance will not trigger the vulnerability. MSN IM inspection is not enabled by default.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID  CSCtl67486 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtl67486"]( registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3304



TACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
AAA enables the ASA to determine who the user is (authentication), what the user can do (authorization), and what the user did (accounting). The Cisco ASA supports TACACS+ authentication for VPN users, firewall sessions, and administrative access to the device.

An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the TACACS+ implementation of the Cisco ASA. Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to bypass TACACS+ authentication of VPN users, firewall sessions, or administrative access to the device. The attacker needs to have access to the network between the ASA and the TACACS+ server in order to successfully exploit this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCto40365 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto40365"]( registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3298.



SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
The Sun RPC inspection engine performs application inspection for the Sun RPC protocol. Sun RPC is used by Network File System (NFS) and Network Information Service (NIS). Sun RPC services can run on any port. When a client attempts to access a Sun RPC service on a server, it must learn the port that service is running on. The client does this by querying the port mapper process, usually rpcbind, on the well-known port of 111.

Four DoS vulnerabilities affect the SunRPC inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, in which an unauthenticated attacker may cause the affected device to reload.

Note:  Only transit traffic can trigger these vulnerabilities; traffic that is destined to the appliance will not trigger the vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by using UDP packets, not TCP. SunRPC inspection is enabled by default.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCto92380 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto92380"]( registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) , CSCtq06065 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq06065"](registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) , CSCtq06062 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq06062"]( registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) , CSCto92398 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto92398"]( registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) ; and have been assigned CVE IDs CVE-2011-3299, CVE-2011-3300, CVE-2011-3301 and CVE-2011-3302



ILS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
The ILS inspection engine provides NAT support for Microsoft NetMeeting, SiteServer, and Active Directory products that use LDAP to exchange directory information with an ILS server.

A DoS vulnerability affects the ILS inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. During successful exploitation, an unauthenticated attacker could cause the affected device to reload and may result in a sustained DoS condition.

Note:  Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability; traffic that is destined to the appliance will not trigger the vulnerability. ILS inspection is not enabled by default.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtq57697 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq57697"]( registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE CVE-2011-3303.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">
This Cisco Security Advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities and their respective workarounds are independent of each other.

MSN Instant Messeger (IM) Inspection DoS Vulnerability
Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling MSN IM inspection if it is not required. Administrators can disable MSN IM inspection by issuing the no inspect im command in class configuration sub-mode in the policy map configuration. Disabling MSN IM inspection may cause MSN IM traffic to stop through the security appliance.

TACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability other than using a different authentication protocol such as RADIUS, Active Directory, etc.

SunRPC Inspection DoS Vulnerabilities
Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling SunRPC inspection if it is not required. Administrators can disable SunRPC inspection by issuing the no inspect sunrpc command in class configuration sub-mode in the policy map configuration. Disabling SunRPC inspection may cause SunRPC traffic to stop through the security appliance.

ILS Inspection DoS Vulnerability
Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling ILS inspection if it is not required. Administrators can disable ILS inspection by issuing the no inspect ils command in class configuration sub-mode in the policy map configuration. Disabling ILS inspection may cause ILS traffic to stop through the security appliance.

        <Description>
This Cisco Security Advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities and their respective workarounds are independent of each other.

MSN Instant Messeger (IM) Inspection DoS Vulnerability
Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling MSN IM inspection if it is not required. Administrators can disable MSN IM inspection by issuing the no inspect im command in class configuration sub-mode in the policy map configuration. Disabling MSN IM inspection may cause MSN IM traffic to stop through the security appliance.

TACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability other than using a different authentication protocol such as RADIUS, Active Directory, etc.

SunRPC Inspection DoS Vulnerabilities
Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling SunRPC inspection if it is not required. Administrators can disable SunRPC inspection by issuing the no inspect sunrpc command in class configuration sub-mode in the policy map configuration. Disabling SunRPC inspection may cause SunRPC traffic to stop through the security appliance.

ILS Inspection DoS Vulnerability
Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling ILS inspection if it is not required. Administrators can disable ILS inspection by issuing the no inspect ils command in class configuration sub-mode in the policy map configuration. Disabling ILS inspection may cause ILS traffic to stop through the security appliance.
