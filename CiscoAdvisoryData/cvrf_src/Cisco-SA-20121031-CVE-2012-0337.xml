    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a SQL injection attack.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to an HTTP POST method. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending HTTP POST requests that contain crafted SQL statements to the targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete data from the Web Conferencing database.



Cisco has confirmed these vulnerabilities in a security advisory and released updated software.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must send malicious requests to the targeted system, likely requiring the attacker to have access to trusted, internal networks. This access requirement limits the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
