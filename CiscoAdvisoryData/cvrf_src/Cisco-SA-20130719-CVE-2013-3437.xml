  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the management application of the Cisco Unified Operations Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary Structured Query Language (SQL) queries.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to validate user-supplied input used in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including SQL statements in an entry field.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be able to authenticate to a targeted device to submit malicious SQL statements. In addition, the attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside. These access requirements could reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">
Customers should refer to Cisco bug ID CSCud80179["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud80179"] for the most complete list of affected product versions.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">At the time this alert was first published, Cisco Unified Operations Manager 8.6 is vulnerable. Later releases of Cisco Unified Operations Manager may also be affected.</cvrf:Note>
