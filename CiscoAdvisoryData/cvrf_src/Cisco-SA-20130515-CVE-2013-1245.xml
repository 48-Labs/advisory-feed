    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the user management page of WebEx Social could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary values into the Screen Name, Email Address, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, and Job Title fields.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side validation of user-supplied information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by bypassing client-side protections to insert arbitrary values into the vulnerable fields.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and has released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would require authenticated access to the targeted device, and may require access to trusted, internal networks. These access requirements could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that the vulnerability is highly exploitable; however, exploit code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
