    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2025-20119: Cisco APIC Authenticated Local DoS Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the system file permission handling of Cisco APIC could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite critical system files, which could cause a DoS condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.

This vulnerability is due to a race condition with handling system files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by doing specific operations on the file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite system files, which could lead to the device being in an inconsistent state and cause a DoS condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwk18865 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk18865"]
CVE ID: CVE-2025-20119
SIR: Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.0
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-20117: Cisco APIC Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco APIC could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments that are passed to specific CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted input as the argument of an affected CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of root.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwk18862 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk18862"]
CVE ID: CVE-2025-20117
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 5.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-20116: Cisco APIC Stored XSS Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco APIC could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored XSS attack on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.

This vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the web UI. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web UI or access sensitive, browser-based information.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwk18863 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk18863"]
CVE ID: CVE-2025-20116
SIR: Medium
CVSS Base Score: 4.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-20118: Cisco APIC Authenticated Information Disclosure Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the implementation of the internal system processes of Cisco APIC could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient masking of sensitive information that is displayed through system CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using reconnaissance techniques at the device CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device that could be used for additional attacks.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
