  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the network stack of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) and Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust all available memory, preventing the affected device from accepting new TCP connections.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of TCP packets sent at a high rate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP packets to the affected system.



Note: A full device reload is needed to recover the system to an operational state.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151104-aos["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151104-aos"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following products running a vulnerable version of the Cisco AsyncOS Software:


    Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), both virtual and hardware versions
    Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA),  both virtual and hardware versions
    Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), both virtual and hardware versions



Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) includes the Cisco ESA and Cisco SMA as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.



Determine Software Version

To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco ESA, administrators can use the version command in the ESA CLI. The following example shows the results for a device running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:


ciscoesa&gt; version
Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance
Model: X1070
Version: 8.5.3-051
.
.
.





To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco SMA, administrators can use the version command in the SMA CLI. The following example shows the results for a device running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 9.1.1-005:


ciscosma&gt; version
Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort M670 Security Management(tm) Appliance
Model: M670
Version: 9.1.1-005
.
.
.





To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the version command in the WSA CLI. The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:


ciscowsa&gt; version
Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security Appliance
Model: S670
Version: 8.5.3-051
.
.
.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. 



In the following tables, the left column lists major releases of
Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco ESA, Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco SMA, and Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco WSA Software. The center column indicates
whether a major release is affected by the vulnerability described in
this advisory and the first minor release that includes the fix for this
vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a major release is
affected by all the vulnerabilities described in this and the following
advisories and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities:

In most cases an ESA, SMA, or WSA can be updated over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the System Administration GUI. To upgrade a device by using the System Administration GUI:


    Choose System Administration &gt; System Upgrade.
    Click Upgrade Options.
    Choose the option to Download and Install or, for an ESA, Download the upgrade.
    Choose the release to upgrade to.
    In the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.
    Click Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.

After the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.
