  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Identity Services Engine versions prior to 2.0 contain a vulnerability that could allow a low-privileged authenticated, remote attacker to access specific web resources that are designed to be accessed only by higher-privileged administrative users.



The vulnerability occurs because specific types of web resources are not correctly filtered for administrative users with different privileges. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating at a low-privileged account and then accessing the web resources directly. An exploit could allow the attacker to access web pages that are reserved for higher-privileged administrative users.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
