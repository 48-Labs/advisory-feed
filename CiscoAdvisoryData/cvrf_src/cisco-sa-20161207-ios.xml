    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco IOS on Catalysts Switches and Nexus 9300 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Layer 2 network storm.



The vulnerability occurs because the software forwards Layer 2 frames that should be consumed by the first hop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting the Layer 2 frame into the network segment. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a Layer 2 network storm and impact the availability of the switches.



There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco IOS Software is affected. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The following workarounds are available:


    For Cisco bug ID CSCux07028["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCux07028"], administrators may upgrade to software version 7.0(3)l2(1) or later or disable LLDP on the attached device
    For Cisco bug ID CSCuu69332["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuu69332"], administrators may consider enabling dot1x system-auth-control in global config mode, which may help mitigate this vulnerability depending on the Layer 2 frame that is being flooded 
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.
