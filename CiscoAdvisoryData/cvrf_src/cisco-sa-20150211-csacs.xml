    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">

Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) prior to version 5.5 patch 8 is vulnerable to a SQL injection
attack in the ACS View reporting interface pages. A
successful attack could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access and modify information such as RADIUS accounting records stored in one of the ACS View databases or to access information in the underlying file system. A previous version of this advisory indicated that a product running version 5.5 patch 7 was not vulnerable; however, customers running version 5.5 patch 7 should upgrade to patch 8 to completely mitigate the vulnerability described in this advisory.




Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150211-csacs["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150211-csacs"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All versions
of Cisco Secure ACS prior to version 5.5 patch 8 are affected by the SQL injection vulnerability in this advisory.



Use the following methods to determine the version of Cisco Secure ACS that is running:


    
    From the Cisco Secure ACS command-line interface (CLI), issue the
    show version command, as shown in the following
    example:

    
    acs55/admin# show version

Cisco Application Deployment Engine OS Release: 2.1

Version information of installed applications

Cisco ACS VERSION INFORMATION
-----------------------------
Version : 5.5.0.46.5
Internal Build ID : B.723
Patches : 
5-5-0-46-5

acs55/admin
    
    
    
    
    On the main login page of the Cisco Secure ACS web-based interface,
    the version information is displayed on the left side of the screen.
    
    From the Cisco Secure ACS web-based interface, log in and click the
    About link at the top right corner of the screen.

The following table maps each Cisco Secure ACS version to its official build number.


    
        
             Version 
             Build 
        
        
             5.0
             5.0.0.21
        
        
             5.1
             5.1.0.44

            
        
        
             5.2
             5.2.0.26
        
        
             5.3
             5.3.0.40
        
        
             5.4
             5.4.0.46
        
        
             5.5
             5.5.0.46
        
    

The presence of an additional
digit after the version number indicates the highest patch level installed. For
example, a version number of 5.5.0.46.6 indicates Cisco Secure
ACS version 5.5 with up to patch 6 installed. The absence of an additional
digit after the version string indicates a Cisco Secure ACS version that does not have any
patches installed. The preceding show version output example above shows a Cisco Secure ACS running version 5.5 Patch 5 (5.5.0.46.5).



</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco Secure ACS versions 5.6 and later are not affected by this vulnerability.



The following Cisco Secure ACS products are not affected by this vulnerability:


    Cisco Secure Access Control Server for Windows
    Cisco Secure Access Control Server Express
    Cisco Secure Access Control Server View
    Cisco Secure Access Control Server Solution Engine

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">A core component of the Cisco TrustSec solution, Cisco Secure ACS is a highly sophisticated policy platform providing RADIUS and TACACS+ services. It supports the increasingly complex policies needed to meet today's new demands for access control management and compliance. Cisco Secure ACS provides central management of access policies for device administration and wireless, wired 802.1x, and remote VPN network access scenarios. The identity stores can be internal or external. An internal identity store has user credential information stored in an internal database. With an external identity store, Cisco Secure ACS will retrieve information from an external database.






A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco ACS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on one of the two ACS View databases. The authentication requires access to an ACS administrator account.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed to the reporting application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the web server using the HTTPS
protocol. 



This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuq79027["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuq79027"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)  ID CVE-2015-0580.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There is no known workaround for this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
