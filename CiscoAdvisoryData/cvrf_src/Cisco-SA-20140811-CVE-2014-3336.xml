  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary queries on
the database.




The vulnerability is due to insufficient controls on Structured Query Language (SQL) statements. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending crafted requests to the web server. An exploit could allow the attacker to read a subset of the data stored in the database.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</cvrf:Note>
