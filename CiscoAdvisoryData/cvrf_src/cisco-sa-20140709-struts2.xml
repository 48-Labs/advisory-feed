    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple Cisco products include an implementation of the Apache Struts 2  component that is affected by a remote command execution vulnerability identified by Apache with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ID CVE-2010-1870.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization on user-supplied input in the XWorks component of the affected software. The component uses the ParameterInterceptors directive to parse the Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions that are implemented via a whitelist feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests  that contain OGNL expressions to an affected system. An  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability  for all the affected products except Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series. Customers using Cisco  Business Edition 3000 Series should contact their Cisco representative for  available options.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.  This advisory is available at the following link:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Apache Struts 2 contains a vulnerability that could  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security  restrictions and execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization on user-supplied input  by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could  exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain OGNL expressions to bypass security restrictions and execute  arbitrary commands on server-side objects.

This vulnerability has been confirmed to allow remote code execution with Administrator privileges for Cisco Unified CCE. Exploitation on Cisco ISE, Cisco MXE 3500, and Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series is theoretically possible but could not be reproduced. Cisco recommends that customers affected by this vulnerability upgrade to a fixed software release version.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCun31197 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun31197"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series, CSCun31314 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun31314"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco ISE, CSCun31301 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun31301"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco MXE 3500, and CSCun25241 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun25241"] (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco Unified CCE.
