    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Catalyst Switches running Cisco IOS Software releases prior to 15.2(2)E1 may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve version information about the software release running on the device by accessing the Network Mobility Services Protocol (NMSP) port.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly secure NMSP with authentication, which has been made standard in Cisco IOS Software releases 15.2(2)E1 and later. An attacker could exploit earlier software releases to map the network and gather information for further attacks.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
