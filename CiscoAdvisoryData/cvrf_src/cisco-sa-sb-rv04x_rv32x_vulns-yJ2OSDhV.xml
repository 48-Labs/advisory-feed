    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, to reduce the attack surface, administrators may disable remote management and block access to ports 443 and 60443. Affected routers will still be accessible through the LAN interface after the mitigation has been implemented.

For instructions on implementing this mitigation, see the following sections.
  Disable Remote Management
To disable remote management, use the following steps:

Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.
Choose Firewall &gt; General.
Uncheck the Remote Management check box.

   Block Access to Ports 443 and 60443
To block access to ports 443 and 60443, a new service must first be added to the access rules of the device for port 60443. It is not necessary to add a service for port 443 because it is predefined in the services list. To add a new service to the access rules for port 60443, use the following steps:

Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.
Choose Firewall &gt; Access Rules.
Click Service Management.
In the Service Name field, enter TCP-60443.
From the Protocol drop-down list, choose TCP.
In both of the Port Range fields, enter 60443.
Click Add to List.
Click OK.

Next, access rules must be created to block ports 443 and 60443. To create an access rule to block port 443, use the following steps:

Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.
Choose Firewall &gt; Access Rules.
Click Add.
From the Action drop-down list, choose Deny.
From the Service drop-down list, choose HTTPS (TCP 443-443).
From the Log drop-down list, choose Log packets match this rule.
From the Source Interface drop-down list, choose the option that matches the WAN connection on the device.
From the Source IP drop-down list, choose Any.
From the Destination IP drop-down list, choose Single.
In both of the Destination IP fields, enter the WAN IP address.
Click Save.

To create an access rule to block port 60443, repeat the preceding steps, but for Step 5, choose HTTPS (TCP 60443-60443) from the Service drop-down list.

Note: If a second WAN port is being used, two additional access control list (ACL) rules must be set up using the WAN number and IP address for the second WAN port.

While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>

Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</Description>

        <Description>There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, to reduce the attack surface, administrators may disable remote management and block access to ports 443 and 60443. Affected routers will still be accessible through the LAN interface after the mitigation has been implemented.

For instructions on implementing this mitigation, see the following sections.
  Disable Remote Management
To disable remote management, use the following steps:

Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.
Choose Firewall &gt; General.
Uncheck the Remote Management check box.

   Block Access to Ports 443 and 60443
To block access to ports 443 and 60443, a new service must first be added to the access rules of the device for port 60443. It is not necessary to add a service for port 443 because it is predefined in the services list. To add a new service to the access rules for port 60443, use the following steps:

Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.
Choose Firewall &gt; Access Rules.
Click Service Management.
In the Service Name field, enter TCP-60443.
From the Protocol drop-down list, choose TCP.
In both of the Port Range fields, enter 60443.
Click Add to List.
Click OK.

Next, access rules must be created to block ports 443 and 60443. To create an access rule to block port 443, use the following steps:

Log in to the web-based management interface for the device.
Choose Firewall &gt; Access Rules.
Click Add.
From the Action drop-down list, choose Deny.
From the Service drop-down list, choose HTTPS (TCP 443-443).
From the Log drop-down list, choose Log packets match this rule.
From the Source Interface drop-down list, choose the option that matches the WAN connection on the device.
From the Source IP drop-down list, choose Any.
From the Destination IP drop-down list, choose Single.
In both of the Destination IP fields, enter the WAN IP address.
Click Save.

To create an access rule to block port 60443, repeat the preceding steps, but for Step 5, choose HTTPS (TCP 60443-60443) from the Service drop-down list.

Note: If a second WAN port is being used, two additional access control list (ACL) rules must be set up using the WAN number and IP address for the second WAN port.

While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions.
