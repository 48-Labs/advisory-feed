    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) contains a file information disclosure vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the underlying operating system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150401-dcnm ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150401-dcnm"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco Prime DCNM releases 6.3(1) and later, prior to release 7.1(1), for both the Microsoft Windows and Linux platforms, are affected by this vulnerability.

To determine the Cisco Prime DCNM release that is running, administrators can connect to the computer that runs the Cisco Prime DCNM software using a web browser and HTTPS; the release number will be displayed in the login page, before logging in. The following example shows a device running version 7.0(2):


Cisco Prime
Data Center Network Manager  Version: 7.0(2)</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco DCNM-LAN Server and Cisco DCNM-SAN Server were different products prior to the release of 6.1(1), when both products converged into a single Cisco Prime DCNM product. The original standalone versions of Cisco DCNM-LAN Server and Cisco DCNM-SAN Server and the converged versions prior to 6.3(1) are not affected by this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco Prime DCNM, previously known as Cisco Data Center Network Manager, is a network management application that combines the management of Ethernet and storage networks into a single dashboard to help network and storage administrators manage and troubleshoot health and performance across different families of Cisco products that run Cisco NX-OS Software.

Cisco Prime DCNM is affected by the following vulnerability:

Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager Directory Traversal Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the fmserver servlet of Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the filesystem.

The vulnerability is due to invalid input validation on the supplied path information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing a directory traversal attack on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disclose arbitrary file contents on the underlying operating system that hosts the Cisco Prime DCNM application. The file contents must be readable by the System user for Cisco Prime DCNM running on Microsoft Windows, or the root user for Cisco Prime DCNM running on Linux for the attacker to exploit them.

This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCus00241 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus00241"] (registered ["http://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2015-0666.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

This vulnerability was first resolved in Cisco DCNM Software version 7.1(1).
