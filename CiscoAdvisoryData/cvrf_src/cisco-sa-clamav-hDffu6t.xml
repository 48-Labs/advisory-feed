  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to an incorrect check for end-of-string values during scanning, which may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software and consuming available system resources.

For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog ["https://blog.clamav.net/2023/11/clamav-130-122-105-released.html"].

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory. Customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug IDs for further details.

Cisco products may be impacted differently depending on implementation and usage of ClamAV. For information on the effects of this vulnerability on specific Cisco products, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
Secure Email Gateway, formerly Email Security Appliance (ESA)
Secure Endpoint Connector for Linux
Secure Endpoint Connector for Mac
Secure Web Appliance

Attention: Simplifying the Cisco portfolio includes the renaming of security products under one brand: Cisco Secure. For more information, see Meet Cisco Secure ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/secure-names.html"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Impacts of ClamAV DoS Vulnerability on Windows Platforms

This vulnerability, which has a High Security Impact Rating (SIR), affects only Windows-based platforms because those platforms run the ClamAV scanning process as a service that could enter a loop condition, which would consume available CPU resources and delay or prevent further scanning operations. See the Assessing Security Risk ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr"] section of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy for information about vulnerability scoring and SIRs.

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause Cisco Secure Endpoint Connector for Windows to enter a loop and stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Secure Endpoint Connector for Windows, which is distributed from Cisco Secure Endpoint Private Cloud, is affected by this vulnerability.
