    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability exists in the Smart Install feature of Cisco Catalyst
Switches running Cisco IOS Software that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform remote code execution on the
affected device.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 


There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability other than disabling the Smart Install feature.

This advisory is posted at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-smart-install["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-smart-install"].



Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories. Nine of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the September 2011 Bundled Publication. 



Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability only affects Cisco Catalyst Switches with the Smart Install feature enabled.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Devices configured as a Smart Install client or director are affected
by this vulnerability. To display Smart Install information, use the show vstack config
privileged EXEC command on the Smart Install director or client.
The outputs of the show commands are different when entered on the
director or on the client. The following is the output of the show vstack config in a Cisco Catalyst Switch configured as a Smart Install client:


switch#show vstack config
 Role: Client
 Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.163 

The following is the output of the show vstack config in a Cisco Catalyst Switch configured as a Smart Install director:


Director# show vstack config

Role: Director
 Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.163
 Vstack Mode: Basic
 Vstack default management vlan: 1
 Vstack management Vlans: none
 Vstack Config file: tftp://10.1.1.100/default-config.txt
 Vstack Image file: tftp://10.1.1.100/c3750e-universalk9-tar.122-
 Join Window Details:
         Window: Open (default)
         Operation Mode: auto (default)
 Vstack Backup Details:
         Mode: On (default)
         Repository: flash:/vstack (default)

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running
on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue
the show version command to display the system banner.
The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software
by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System
Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in
parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release
name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is
running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image
name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:


Router&gt; show version
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.


Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability.


No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Smart Install is a plug-and-play configuration and image-management feature that provides zero-touch deployment for new switches. This means that a customer can ship a switch to a location, place it in the network and power it on with no configuration required on the switch.

A vulnerability exists in the Smart Install feature of Cisco Catalyst Switches running Cisco IOS Software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform remote code execution on the affected device. Smart Install uses TCP port 4786 for communication. An established TCP connection with a completed TCP three-way handshake is needed to be able to trigger this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCto10165, and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-3271.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability
other than disabling the Smart Install feature. The Smart Install
Feature is enabled by default in client switches. No configuration is
needed in client switches. 

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices
within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation
Bulletin companion document for this advisory, which is available at the
following link: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20110928-smart-install["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20110928-smart-install"]

    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">
When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"]
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade
solution. 

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be
certain the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by
the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance.


Additionally, the Cisco IOS Software Checker is available on the Cisco Security (SIO) portal at
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x"].
It provides several features for checking which Security Advisories affect
specified versions of Cisco IOS Software.

Cisco IOS Software
Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a
Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest
releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release For This
Advisory column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September
2011 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that
correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security
Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest
available release, where possible.
