    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) when configured as Central Manager (CM), contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute  arbitrary code on the affected system.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.  This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130731-waascm ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130731-waascm"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The following products running a vulnerable version of Cisco WAAS Software and configured as Central Manager (CM) are affected by this vulnerability:

Cisco WAAS Appliances
Cisco Virtual WAAS (vWAAS)
Cisco WAAS Modules
  Note: Only Cisco WAAS products configured as Central Manager are affected by this vulnerability.

To determine whether the Cisco WAAS Software is configured as CM use the show cms info command. The following example shows Cisco WAAS Software configured as CM:

ciscowaas-cm#show cms info
Device registration information :
Device Id                            = 182
Device registered as                 = WAAS Central Manager
Current WAAS Central Manager role    = Primary
CMS services information :  Service cms_httpd is running  Service cms_cdm is running</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">The following products running Cisco WAAS Software are not affected by this vulnerability:

Cisco WAAS Express (WAASx)
Cisco WAAS Mobile
  No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco WAAS application acceleration and WAN optimization solutions accelerate the performance of any TCP-based application delivered across a WAN, providing the benefits of branch-office data consolidation and acceleration of centralized applications.

Every WAAS network must have one primary WAAS CM device that is responsible for managing the other WAAS  devices in the network. The Cisco WAAS CM device hosts the Cisco WAAS CM GUI, a web-based interface that allows configuration, management and monitoring of the associated Cisco WAAS devices.

A vulnerability in the web service framework code of Cisco WAAS, when configured as Central  Manager (CM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute  arbitrary code on the affected system.

The vulnerability is due  to insufficient input validation. An attacker could  exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the  affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the  affected system. Due to the privileged function of the WAAS CM  in the Cisco WAAS network, exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker  to gain administrative access to all the devices that have been  associated to the vulnerable WAAS CM.

Note: Only Cisco WAAS Software configured as CM is affected by this vulnerability.
