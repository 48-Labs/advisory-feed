  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cisco Aironet 1850 Series Access Point device could allow an authenticated, local attacker to obtain elevated privileges to the restricted shell on the device.



The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper escape protections when validating CLI commands entered at the device prompt. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering malicious commands at the CLI to obtain access to the restricted shell. An exploit could allow the attacker to obtain root-level privileges on the affected device.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available. This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151005-aironet["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151005-aironet"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco Aironet 1850 Series Access Point devices running Cisco Aironet Access Point Software Release 8.1(112.4) are vulnerable. 
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">If the AAA server logs include records indicating that an authenticated user is performing actions at a higher privilege level than their originally assigned user role, this may indicate that the affected device has been compromised by this vulnerability. In particular, this vulnerability can allow a user to gain root-level privileges. Therefore, commands executed with root-level privileges should be reviewed in detail.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">No workarounds are available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
