Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS), Cisco Expressway and Cisco TelePresence Conductor contain the following vulnerabilities:


    
    SDP Media Description Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

Successful exploitation of the SDP Media Description Denial of Service Vulnerability may
cause the affected system to reload.

Successful exploitation of the Authentication Bypass Vulnerability may allow an attacker to
bypass authentication and log in to the system with the privileges of an administrator.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150311-vcs["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150311-vcs"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities apply to the following products running an affected version of software:


    Cisco TelePresence VCS Control
    Cisco
    TelePresence VCS Expressway
    Cisco TelePresence VCS Starter Pack
    Expressway
    Cisco Expressway Core
    Cisco Expressway Edge 
    Cisco TelePresence Conductor 

Cisco TelePresence VCS, Cisco Expressway, and Cisco TelePresence Conductor hardware and virtual appliances are affected by these vulnerabilities.




</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco TelePresence VCS
extends the benefits of face-to-face video collaboration across networks
and organizations by supporting any-to-any video and telepresence
communications.



Cisco Expressway is designed specifically for
comprehensive
collaboration services provided through Cisco Unified Communications
Manager, Cisco Business Edition, or Cisco Hosted Collaboration Solution.
It features established firewall-traversal technology and helps
redefine traditional enterprise collaboration boundaries.



Cisco TelePresence Conductor simplifies multiparty video collaboration by orchestrating the allocation of conferencing resources for every user in a
meeting.




SDP Media Description Denial of Service Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the  Session Description Protocol (SDP) packet handler
function  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a
reload of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to
improper handling of an exception when receiving crafted SDP packets. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SDP
packets to the affected system.



Note: This vulnerability can be triggered by SDP messages sent via UDP or
TCP. Messages sent via Transport Layer Security (TLS) will also be affected.
The default ports for UDP and TCP deployments are UDP port 5060 and TCP
port 5060. The default port for TLS deployment is TCP port 5061. This vulnerability can be triggered via IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) packets.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCus96593["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus96593"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence VCS and Cisco Expressway and Cisco bug ID CSCun73192["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun73192"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence Conductor.



This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0652.



Authentication Bypass Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the authentication
code  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the system
login and successfully authenticate to the system.

The
vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of parameters passed
during the login process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by sending a crafted request to the system. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the authentication
controls and successfully log in to the system. An attacker would need to
have knowledge of a valid username. The attacker will receive the privilege of that user after logging in. This vulnerability could give the attacker administrative access to the affected system.





Note: This vulnerability can be exploited over HTTPS only and targeting the management interface of the affected system. A valid TCP handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered via IPv4 and IPv6 packets.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCur02680["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCur02680"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence VCS and Cisco Expressway and Cisco bug ID CSCur05556["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCur05556"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence Conductor



This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0653.
