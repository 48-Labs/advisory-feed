How to Determine the Software Version
Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch devices that are running an affected version of software are vulnerable. 

To determine the current version of software that is running on the Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch, establish an SSH connection to the device and issue the show version active and the show version inactive commands. The output should resemble the following example:


admin: show version active
Active Master Version: 1.7.0.0-471

Active Version Installed Software Options: 
No Installed Software Options Found.

admin: show version inactive
Inactive Master Version: 1.6.0.0-342

Inactive Version Installed Software Options: 
No Installed Software Options Found.

In the preceding example, the system has versions 1.6.0 and 1.7.0 loaded on the device, and version 1.7.0 is currently active. A device is affected only by vulnerabilities that are in the active software version.

This section provides additional information for each vulnerability that affects Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch.



Cisco TelePresence Malformed IP Packets Denial of Service Vulnerability



A vulnerability exists in the network stack of the operating system that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service condition, preventing the device from responding to new connection requests and potentially leading to the crash of some of the services and processes. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of malformed IP packets and TCP connection requests or terminations sent at a high rate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted sequence of malformed IP packets or TCP segments at a high rate.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCty11219["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty11219"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only), CSCty11299["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty11299"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only), CSCty11323["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty11323"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and CSCty11338["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty11338"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-3073.



Cisco TelePresence Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability 



A remote code execution vulnerability in the implementation of the Cisco
Discovery Protocol component could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent
attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The
vulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle malformed Cisco
Discovery Protocol packets.  An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by passing malformed Cisco
Discovery Protocol packets to an
affected device.  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.



Because Cisco Discovery Protocol works at the data link layer (Layer 2),
an attacker must have a way to submit an Ethernet frame directly to an
affected device. This action may be possible in situations where the affected
system is part of a bridged network or connected to a non partitioned
device, such as a network hub.




This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtz40965["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz40965"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-2486</cvrf:Note>
