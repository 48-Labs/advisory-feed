    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco AsyncOS Software for Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) contain a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the root user.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140319-asyncos["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140319-asyncos"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All models of
Cisco ESA and Cisco SMA running a vulnerable version of Cisco IronPort
AsyncOS Software or Cisco AsyncOS Software are affected by the vulnerability described in this security advisory.



In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to enable the FTP service and Safelist/Blocklist (SLBL) service on the affected system, rely on the fact that these services are already enabled or convince the system administrator to at least temporarily enable them. 



Note: The two services do not have to be enabled at the same time in order for the attack to succeed.



To determine whether the FTP service is actively listening for new connections use the netstat command from the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cisco ESA or Cisco SMA and verify that TCP port 21 is in the LISTEN state.



The following example shows a Cisco ESA with the FTP service active (in the LISTEN state):




ciscoesa&gt; netstat

Choose the information you want to display:
1. List of active sockets.
2. State of network interfaces.
3. Contents of routing tables.
4. Size of the listen queues.
5. Packet traffic information.
[1]&gt; 

1. IPv4 only.
2. IPv6 only.
[1]&gt; 

Show network addresses as numbers? [N]&gt; y

Avoid truncating addresses? [N]&gt; 

Active Internet connections (including servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address       (state)
tcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.443      *.*                    LISTEN
tcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.80       *.*                    LISTEN
tcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.25       *.*                    LISTEN
tcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.21       *.*                    LISTEN


Note: TCP port 21 is the default port for the FTP service; however, this is configurable at the time the service is activated. Customer should review all open ports to determine whether the FTP service has been enabled on a different port.

The FTP service may be enabled by default on some version of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA and Cisco SMA.



To determine whether the SLBL service is enabled, use the slblconfig command. The following example shows a Cisco ESA with the SLBL service enabled.




ciscoesa&gt; slblconfig
End-User Safelist/Blocklist: Enabled
[...] 
Note: The SLBL service is not enabled by default.

Determining the Running Software Version
To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS
Software is running on a Cisco ESA, administrators can issue the version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software version 7.6.2-201:


ciscoesa&gt; version
Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance
Model: X1070
Version: 7.6.2-201
[...]

To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS
Software is running on an Cisco Content SMA, administrators can issue the version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software version 7.9.1-039:


ciscosma&gt; version
Current Version
===============
Product: Cisco IronPort M670 Security Management(tm) Appliance
Model: M670
Version: 7.9.1-039
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) is not affected by this vulnerability.



No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco Email Security Appliance provides email management and
protection combining antispam, antivirus, and encryption technologies.



The Cisco Content Security Management Appliance consolidates policy and
run-time data in a single management interface, providing a centralized
platform for all reporting and auditing for Cisco Email and Web Security
Appliances.



A vulnerability in the End User Safelist/Blocklist (SLBL)
function of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.



The
vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the SLBL database file.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by substituting a valid
SLBL database file with a tampered file. The tampered file could contain
shell code that would be executed by the affected system when a specific
event is triggered (for example, when a new email is received that
triggers the SLBL check). To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have the FTP and SLBL services enabled, at least temporarily, and have valid credentials to upload the tampered
SLBL database file via FTP. 



An exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the root
user.



This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID CSCug79377["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug79377"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco ESA and CSCug80118["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug80118"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) for Cisco Content SMA. This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2119.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. Disabling the FTP service will reduce the exposure to this vulnerability because it could prevent replacing the SLBL database file with a malicious one.

In addition to disabling the FTP service, disabling the SLBL service will reduce the exposure to this vulnerability because it could prevent the execution of content of the malicious SLBL database file.



The only method to disable SLBL is by using the GUI. Navigate to Monitor &gt;  Spam Quarantine and click the Edit Setting button under the End-User Safelist/Blocklist (Spam Quarantine) area. In the Edit window, uncheck the           Enable End User Safelist/Blocklist Feature check-box and click Submit.</Description>
