  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the configuration of the XML parser of Cisco Prime Service Catalog could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data stored on the host operating system or cause system resource consumption that could cause a denial of service condition. 



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150128-psc-xmlee["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150128-psc-xmlee"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">All versions of Cisco Prime Service Catalog prior to 10.1 are affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">A vulnerability in the configuration of the XML parser of Cisco Prime Service Catalog could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data or cause system resource consumption that could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML external entities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted HTTP requests to the Prime Service Catalog Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based web services. To complete a successful attack, the attacker also needs a server that is reachable from the Cisco Prime Service Catalog. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access data stored on the host operating system, consume system resources, or cause a DoS condition. The disclosed data could contain sensitive information, which may include private keys and passwords.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCup92880["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup92880"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0581



Given the characteristics of this vulnerability, Cisco recommends customers generate new public/private key pairs, obtain a new certificate for that key pair, and install the new certificate and associated key pair as appropriate on all affected deployments after installing the software updates. Cisco also recommends changing the passwords for access to the host operating system and policy orchestration integration.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no mitigations that can be performed manually on the affected system.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.



Cisco has released Prime Service Catalog 10.1 as well as a patch for 9.4.1, 9.4.1R2, 10.0, and 10.0R2 to remediate the vulnerability described in this document.
