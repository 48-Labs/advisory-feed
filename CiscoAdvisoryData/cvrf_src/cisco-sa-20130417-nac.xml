    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC) Manager contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and take full control of the vulnerable system. A successful attack could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access, create or modify any information in the NAC Manager database. 



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 



There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130417-nac["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130417-nac"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2"></cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco NAC Manager versions prior to the following are affected by this vulnerability:


    4.9.2
    4.8.3.1



The software version of a NAC Manager system can be determined by navigating to Administration &gt; CCA Manager &gt; Software Upload | Current Version via the administration interface.

The software version can also be determined by running the command cat /perfigo/build in the command-line interface (CLI).



The following example shows a system running affected version (4.9.1) of the software:






[root@nacmanager ~]# cat /perfigo/build 
VERSION=4.9.1
NAME=Clean Access Manager.



Note: Cisco NAC Manager is part of the Cisco NAC Appliance, formerly known as Cisco Clean Access. Software versions 4.1.3 and later are using the name Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC).





</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">With the exception of Cisco NAC Manager no other Cisco products are known to be affected by this vulnerability.




Note: The Cisco NAC Server and NAC Agent components of the Cisco NAC Appliance are not affected by this vulnerability.

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">The Cisco NAC Appliance solution allows network administrators to authenticate, authorize, evaluate, and remediate wired, wireless, and remote users and their machines prior to allowing users onto the network. The solution identifies whether machines are compliant with security policies and repairs vulnerabilities before permitting access to the network.



Cisco NAC Manager contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and take full control of the vulnerable system.



This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied requests by the Cisco NAC Manager. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting Structured Query Language (SQL) commands. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary queries and take full control of the affected system.





This vulnerability is documented in CSCub23095["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub23095"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2013-1177.
