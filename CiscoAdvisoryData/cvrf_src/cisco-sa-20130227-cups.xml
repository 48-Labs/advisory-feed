Denial of Service Vulnerability



Cisco Unified Presence Server (CUPS) contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this issue by sending crafted packets to a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) port (TCP port 5060) resulting in an increase in CPU utilization that could lead to a disruption of services. This vulnerability is described in Cisco bug ID CSCua89930["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua89930"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only), and is assigned the CVE Identifier CVE-2013-1137.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Filtering traffic from untrusted sources on TCP port 5060 can provide a workaround for this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
