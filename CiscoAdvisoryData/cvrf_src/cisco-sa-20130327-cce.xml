    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco IOS Software contains a memory leak vulnerability that could be triggered through the processing of malformed Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages. Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an interruption of services. Only devices that are configured for SIP inspection are affected by this vulnerability.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds for devices that must run SIP inspection.



This advisory is available at the following link:



https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130327-cce["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130327-cce"]



Note: The March 27, 2013, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the March 2013 bundled publication. 

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2" />
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software versions are vulnerable when Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) application layer gateway (ALG) inspection is configured under the Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW).

To verify whether the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) application layer gateway (ALG) inspection under the Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) is configured on a device use the show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include sip privileged EXEC command and check whether the output includes Match: protocol sip. The following is the output from the show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include sip command executed on a device running Cisco IOS Software that has the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) application layer gateway (ALG) inspection enabled under the Zone-based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) configuration:

 


Cisco#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include sip
      Match: protocol sip
Inspection of SIP traffic is not enabled by default.



Network Address Translation (NAT) of SIP traffic is not affected by this issue.



To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

Router&gt; show version 
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Enhanced Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) inspection is a Cisco IOS firewall feature that provides basic SIP deep packet inspection functionality (SIP packet inspection and pinholes opening) as well as protocol conformance and application security.



A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) inspection feature under the Zone-based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that would eventually lead to a device reload.



This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed SIP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SIP messages through the device. An exploit could cause Cisco IOS Software not to release allocated memory, causing a memory leak. A sustained attack may result in a device reload.



SIP traffic can use UDP port 5060 and TCP ports 5060 and 5061.



Network Address Translation (NAT) of SIP traffic is not affected by this issue.



Note: Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability; SIP traffic destined to a vulnerable device cannot trigger this vulnerability.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtl99174["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtl99174"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only), and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1145.



</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Disabling inspection of SIP traffic will mitigate this vulnerability. Inspection of SIP traffic can be disabled by removing the match protocol sip command from the corresponding class map used by the Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) configuration. The following example shows how to remove this command from the class map:


router(config)#class-map type inspect match-any INSP-TRAFFIC-PROTOCOL
router(config-cmap)#no match protocol sip
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. 

Cisco IOS Software
Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.

The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases. This tool is available on the Cisco Security (SIO) portal at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x"]

      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>Disabling inspection of SIP traffic will mitigate this vulnerability. Inspection of SIP traffic can be disabled by removing the match protocol sip command from the corresponding class map used by the Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) configuration. The following example shows how to remove this command from the class map:


router(config)#class-map type inspect match-any INSP-TRAFFIC-PROTOCOL
router(config-cmap)#no match protocol sip
