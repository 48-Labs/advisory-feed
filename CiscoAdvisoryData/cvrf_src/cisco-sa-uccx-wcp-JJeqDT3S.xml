    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Tomcat implementation for Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a web cache poisoning attack on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to a specific API endpoint on the Unified CCX Finesse Portal. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the internal WebProxy to redirect users to an attacker-controlled host.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
