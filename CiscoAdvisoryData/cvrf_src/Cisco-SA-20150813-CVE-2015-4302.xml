    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface function to delete a system policy configured in the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center application could allow unauthenticated, remote attackers to delete a system policy other than their own.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain fields of the HTTP POST request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request with parameters of another system policy that the attacker is not authorized to delete. An exploit could allow the attacker to compromise the integrity of the application by the unexpected removal of a system policy. Availability may also be affected.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, updates are unavailable.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires authenticated access to the targeted system. Authenticated access may require the attacker to access trusted, internal networks. These requirements could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco has released bug ID CSCuu25390["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCut04556"] for registered users, which contains additional details and an up-to-date list of affected product versions.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">At the time this alert was first published, Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center Release 5.3.1.4 was vulnerable. Later releases may also be vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
