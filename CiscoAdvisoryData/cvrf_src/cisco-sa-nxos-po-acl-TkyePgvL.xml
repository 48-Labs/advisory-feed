    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming for port channel subinterfaces of Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send traffic that should be blocked through an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to incorrect hardware programming that occurs when configuration changes are made to port channel member ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access network resources that should be protected by an ACL that was applied on port channel subinterfaces.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-po-acl-TkyePgvL ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-po-acl-TkyePgvL"]

This advisory is part of the February 2024 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: February 2024 Semiannual Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75059"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode if they were running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 9.3(10), 9.3(11), or 9.3(12) and had an ingress ACL configured on at least one port channel subinterface, as shown in the following example:


nxos# show running-config interface port-channel 10.10

interface port-channel10.10
  encapsulation dot1q 10
  ip access-group acl-10 in
  ip address 10.10.1.1/24
  no shutdown

Note: When using an affected configuration, any changes made to port channel member ports may result in ACL programming errors.
  Determine Whether the ACL Programming is Affected
To determine whether the ACL programming is affected, use the show system internal access-list interface port-channel subinterface input entries detail command at the device CLI. In a regular ACL programming situation, the command is expected to return ACL entries that are associated to the subinterface in question, as seen in the following example:


nxos# show system internal access-list interface port-channel 10.10 input entries detail
slot  1

If the command returns no entries for a port channel subinterface that is configured with an access list, ACL programming is affected, as seen in the following example:


nxos# show system internal access-list interface port-channel 10.10 input entries detail

    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

After performing configuration changes to port channel member ports, verify whether the ACL programming is affected on any port channel subinterface, as shown in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory. Proper ACL programming can be restored on any affected port channel subinterface by removing and reapplying the associated ip access-group configuration command. Reloading an affected device would also fix the ACL programming for all affected subinterfaces.

While these workarounds have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
        Cisco NX-OS Software
To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"].
