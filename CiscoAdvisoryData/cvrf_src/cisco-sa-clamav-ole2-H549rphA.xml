    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Object Linking and Embedding 2 (OLE2) decryption routine of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to an integer underflow in a bounds check that allows for a heap buffer overflow read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate the ClamAV scanning process, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software.

For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog ["https://blog.clamav.net/2025/01/clamav-142-and-108-security-patch.html"].

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
