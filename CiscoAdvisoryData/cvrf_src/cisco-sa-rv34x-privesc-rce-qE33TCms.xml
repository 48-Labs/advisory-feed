    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has not released and will not release software updates that address these vulnerabilities because the affected products are past their respective dates for End of Software Maintenance Releases. The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) will continue to evaluate and disclose security vulnerabilities that affect these products until they reach their respective Last Dates of Support.

There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv34x-privesc-rce-qE33TCms ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv34x-privesc-rce-qE33TCms"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco RV Series Small Business Routers:

RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers
RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Routers
RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers
RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit PoE VPN Routers

Determine the Device Configuration

The web-based management interface of these devices is available through a local LAN connection, which cannot be disabled, or through the WAN connection if the remote management feature is enabled. By default, the remote management feature is disabled on these devices.

To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled on a device, open the web-based management interface and choose Basic Settings &gt; Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled on the device.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco RV Series Small Business Routers:

RV160 VPN Routers
RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Routers
RV260 VPN Routers
RV260P VPN Routers with PoE
RV260W Wireless-AC VPN Routers</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2024-20393: Cisco RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface discloses sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to elevate privileges from guest to admin.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwm27935 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwm27935"]
CVE ID: CVE-2024-20393
Security Impact Rating (SIR): High
CVSS Base Score: 8.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-20470: Cisco RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid admin credentials.

This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system.

There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
