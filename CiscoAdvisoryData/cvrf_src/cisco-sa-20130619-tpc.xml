    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software contain two vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Additionally, Cisco TelePresence TC Software contain an adjacent root access vulnerability that could allow an attacker on the same physical or logical Layer-2 network as the affected system to gain an unauthenticated root shell.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate the Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software SIP Denial of Service vulnerabilities are available.
This advisory is available at the following link:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software SIP Denial of Service Vulnerabilities



Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software contains two different vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition.

Both vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of crafted SIP packets sent to the affected system. An attacker could exploit both vulnerabilities by sending crafted SIP packets to the affected system.



The first vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue01743["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue01743"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3377.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause a reload of the affected system.



The second vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuf89557["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf89557"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3378.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause the affected system to become unresponsive for a certain amount of time. Repeated exploitation may lead to a denial of service condition.



Cisco TelePresence TC Software Adjacent root Access Vulnerability



A vulnerability in the implementation of firewall rules could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain root shell access to an affected system.



The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of allowed hosts in the firewall rules. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the management IP address of the affected system. The attacker would need to be logically or physically adjacent to exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain root access to the shell.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCts37781["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts37781"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3379.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software SIP Denial of Service Vulnerabilities



If SIP it is not in use, a possible workaround for these vulnerabilities can be achieved by disabling the SIP service: set the NetworkServices SIP Mode to Off by issuing the following xCommand:
xConfiguration NetworkServices SIP Mode: Off
Alternatively, administrators can use the web interface to disable the SIP service: navigate to Configuration &gt; Advanced Configuration &gt; Network Services and set the SIP mode to Off.
