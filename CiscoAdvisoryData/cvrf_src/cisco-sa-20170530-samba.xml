    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">A vulnerability in Samba could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker who has access to a writable share on a targeted system could upload malicious, shared libraries to the writable share. When the targeted system loads and execute the malicious, shared libraries, the attacker could execute arbitrary code, which could be used to conduct further attacks.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="6">To help detect exploitation of this vulnerability, Cisco has released Snort rules with SIDs 43002 through 43004 ["https://www.snort.org/advisories/talos-rules-2017-05-25"]. The alert is generated by SID 43004.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="7">Any workarounds, if available, are documented in the Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="8">When Cisco releases free software updates, customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

To determine the affected and fixed releases for each vulnerable  product, refer to the Cisco bug identified for the product. These bugs are listed in the  table in the Vulnerable Products ["#vulnerable"] section of this advisory. Cisco bugs are  accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"].</cvrf:Note>
