  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Identity Services Engine and Secure Access Control System could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to program data.



The vulnerability is due to weak authentication and authorization used to control access to support bundles stored on a targeted device. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability through brute-force authentication attacks. If successful, the attacker could download files contained within the support bundle, possibly resulting in information disclosure.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




The contents of the support bundle determine the overall impact of any exploit. If the files within the support bundle contain confidential information, the attacker could use the information gained to conduct further attacks against a targeted system.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco has released bug IDs CSCue00833["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue00833"] and CSCub40331["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub40331"] for registered users, which contain additional details and up-to-date lists of affected product versions.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">At the time this alert was first published, Cisco Secure Access Control System versions prior to 5.4(0.46.2) and 5.5(0.46) and Cisco Identity Services Engine version 1.0(4.573) were vulnerable. Later releases of Cisco Secure Access Control System and Cisco Identity Services Engine may also be vulnerable.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.



Administrators may consider removing old or unneeded storage bundles from exposed devices.



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</cvrf:Note>
