    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability
A device running Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if IKE version 1 is enabled. IKE version 1 is enabled if the command crypto isakmp enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.3.x and earlier) or crypto ikev1 enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.4.x and later) is configured.



IKE version 1 is not enabled by default.

Crafted URL Denial of Service Vulnerability
A device running Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the device is using authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users are enabled. HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users are enabled if the command aaa authentication listener is configured.



AAA for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users are not enabled by default.

Denial of Service During Validation of Crafted Certificates
To be vulnerable, Cisco ASA Software must have at least one authenticated trustpoint enrolled with a third-party certificate authority or enrolled with the Cisco ASA local certificate authority. 

To determine whether Cisco ASA Software is configured with an authenticated trustpoint, use the show crypto ca certificate command and verify that the certificate is associated to at least one trustpoint. The following example shows a certificate associated to a trustpoint called 'test' 


ciscoasa# show crypto ca certificates
[...]
  Status: Available
  [...]
  Associated Trustpoints: test

Digital certificate authentication is not enabled by default.

DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if DNS inspection is enabled. 

To determine whether DNS inspection is enabled, use the show service-policy | include dns command. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with DNS inspection enabled: 


ciscoasa# show service-policy | include dns
    Inspect: dns preset_dns_map, packet 0, lock fail 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0 
DNS inspection is enabled by default.

Determining the Running Software Version
To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the show version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco ASA Software version 8.4(1):


ciscoasa#show version | include Version
Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) 
Device Manager Version 6.4(1)

Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco ASA-CX Context-Aware Security is not affected by any of these vulnerabilities.



With the exception of the Cisco FWSM, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is the operating system used by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, the Cisco ASA Services Module (ASASM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, and the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall. The Cisco ASA family provides network security services such as firewall, intrusion prevention system (IPS), anti-X, and VPN.



Cisco ASA Software contains multiple vulnerabilities that may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.

IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability
The IKE version 1 implementation contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of an incoming IKE version 1 message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IKE message.  An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.



Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects routed firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) traffic.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub85692["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub85692"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1149.

Crafted URL Denial of Service Vulnerability
A vulnerability in the URL processing code of the authentication proxy feature of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to mishandling of a crafted URL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to an affected device.  An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service condition.

Both transit traffic and traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. 

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud16590["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud16590"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1150.

Denial of Service During Validation of Crafted Certificates
A vulnerability in the implementation of the function used to validate digital certificates for authentication could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.



This vulnerability is due to an implementation error in the code that validates the digital certificates used during authentication.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted certificate to trigger an authentication operation on an affected device.

Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc72408["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc72408"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1151.

DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
Cisco ASA Software DNS application inspection supports DNS message controls that provide protection against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning.

A vulnerability in the DNS inspection engine code of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of the affected device.



This vulnerability is due to improper processing of some fields in DNS messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS message that triggers inspection by an affected device.



Only transit traffic can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc80080["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc80080"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1152

</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">

IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability
Disabling IKE version 1, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. Note that disabling IKE version 1 will disable IPsec-based VPN tunnels (LAN-to-LAN and remote access) that are configured to use IKE version 1 for Security Association (SA) negotiation and establishment. However, if administrators use only SSL VPN (remote access only), it may be possible to disable IKE version 1 with no impact to the VPN solution. IKE version 1 can be disabled with the global configuration commands  no crypto isakmp enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.3.x and earlier) or no crypto ikev1 enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.4.x and later).

IKE version 2 is not affected by this vulnerability, so migrating to IKE version 2 and disabling IKE version 1 will eliminate this vulnerability.

Crafted URL Denial of Service Vulnerability
Disabling AAA for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users can be disabled with the global configuration command no aaa authentication listener.

Denial of Service During Validation of Crafted Certificates
There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.

DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
Disabling DNS inspection, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the DNS inspection that is configured by default: 


ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy
ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default
ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect dns

IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability
Disabling IKE version 1, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. Note that disabling IKE version 1 will disable IPsec-based VPN tunnels (LAN-to-LAN and remote access) that are configured to use IKE version 1 for Security Association (SA) negotiation and establishment. However, if administrators use only SSL VPN (remote access only), it may be possible to disable IKE version 1 with no impact to the VPN solution. IKE version 1 can be disabled with the global configuration commands  no crypto isakmp enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.3.x and earlier) or no crypto ikev1 enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.4.x and later).

IKE version 2 is not affected by this vulnerability, so migrating to IKE version 2 and disabling IKE version 1 will eliminate this vulnerability.

Crafted URL Denial of Service Vulnerability
Disabling AAA for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users can be disabled with the global configuration command no aaa authentication listener.

Denial of Service During Validation of Crafted Certificates
There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.

DNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
Disabling DNS inspection, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the DNS inspection that is configured by default: 


ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy
ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default
ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect dns
