    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) player contains three buffer overflow vulnerabilities. In some cases, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of a targeted user.



The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. The players can also be manually installed for offline playback after downloading the application from www.webex.com["http://www.webex.com/"].



If the WRF player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the WRF player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from www.webex.com["http://www.webex.com/"].



Cisco has updated affected versions of the WebEx meeting sites and WRF player to address these vulnerabilities. 



This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120404-webex["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120404-webex"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">The vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) player. The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS 27) are affected by at least one of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:


    Client builds 27.32.0 (T27 LD SP32) and prior 
    Client builds 27.25.9 (T27 LC SP25 EP9) and prior 
    Client builds 27.21.10 (T27 LB SP21 EP10) and prior  
    Client builds 27.11.26 (T27 L SP11 EP26) and prior 

To determine the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and navigate to the Support &gt; Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page. Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.10 is fixed, build 27.32.11 will also contain the software update. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, such as T27 SP25 EP10.  Such an example indicates that the server is running client build 27.25.10.

Note: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance. 
</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.



WBS 28 is not affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The WebEx meeting service is a hosted multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The WRF file format is used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players are applications that are used to play back and edit recording files, which use the .wrf extension. The WRF players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for stream playback mode). The WRF player can also be manually installed after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html["http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"] to play back recording files locally (for offline playback mode).



The following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers have been assigned for the buffer overflows in this advisory:


    CVE-2012-1335 
    CVE-2012-1336 
    CVE-2012-1337 


Exploitation of the vulnerabilities may cause the player application to crash or, in some cases, result in remote code execution.



To exploit one of these vulnerabilities, the player application must open a malicious WRF file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file directly to users (for example, by using e-mail) or by directing a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities cannot be triggered by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities described in this document.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt/"] and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance. 

The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27) correct the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:


    Client builds 27.25.10 (T27 LC SP25 EP10) 
    Client builds 27.32.1 (T27 LD SP32 CP1) 

Client builds prior to T27 SP25 have reached end of support; in order to obtain fixed software please upgrade to the latest version.

To determine the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and navigate to the Support &gt; Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page. Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.25.10 is fixed, build 27.25.11 will also contain the software update. 

The Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the Cisco WRF players are all affected. If a player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site.  If a Cisco WebEx recording player was manually installed, users must download the latest version from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html["http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"] and install it. To remove the players completely, access the Meeting Services Removal Tool or Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller (for Apple Mac users) at http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html["http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html"].

Users can determine whether a player is affected by these vulnerabilities by manually verifying the installed version. To do so, users can examine the file version and determine whether it contains the fixed code.  

Microsoft Windows

One dynamic link library (DLL) was updated on the Microsoft Windows platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. These files are located in the C:\Program Files\WebEx\Record Playback folder or the C:\Program Files (x86)\Webex\Record Player folder. The version number of a DLL can be obtained by browsing the Record Playback directory in Windows Explorer, right-clicking the filename, and choosing Properties. The Version or Details tab of the Properties page provides details on the library version. The following table provides the first fixed version for the DLL atas32.dll.
