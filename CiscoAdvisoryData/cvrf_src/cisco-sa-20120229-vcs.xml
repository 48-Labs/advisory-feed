    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Servers running software versions prior to X7.0.1 contain vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to cause a
denial of service (DoS) condition.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.  There are no workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities.



This advisory is available at the following link: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120229-vcs["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120229-vcs"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">These vulnerabilities affect all three variants (Control, Expressway, and Starter Pack Express) of Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server. </cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server
extends the benefits of face-to-face video collaboration across networks
and organizations by supporting any-to-any video and telepresence
communications.



Software versions prior to X7.0.1 contain vulnerabilities that
could cause a crash of the affected device and result in a DoS
condition. These vulnerabilities are triggered by a crafted Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) packet that is sent to an affected device on either TCP and UDP
ports 5060 or 5061. 



These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtr20426["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr20426"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and CSCtq73319["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq73319"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only), and have been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) IDs CVE-2012-0330 and CVE-2012-0331, respectively. </cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds available that mitigate these vulnerabilities.



Additional
mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are
available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this
advisory: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20120229-vcs["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20120229-vcs"].



In order to improve the security posture of their installations, users are recommended to consult the Cisco TelePresence Hardening Guide, which is available at: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/TP_Harden_Guide_wp.html.["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/TP_Harden_Guide_wp.html"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. 

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. 

These vulnerabilities have been fixed in the X7.0.1 version of the software.
