    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) processing in the egress direction of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL.

This vulnerability exists because certain packets are handled incorrectly when they are received on an ingress interface on one line card and destined out of an egress interface on another line card where the egress ACL is configured. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an egress ACL on the affected device.

For more information about this vulnerability, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-modular-ACL-u5MEPXMm ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-modular-ACL-u5MEPXMm"]

This advisory is part of the March 2025 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2025 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75548"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and had egress IPv4 or IPv6 packet filtering enabled:

8000 Series Modular Platforms – the following models only:
8608 Routers
8804 Routers
8808 Routers
8812 Routers
8818 Routers

IOSXRWBD modular variant (distributed disaggregated chassis)
Network Convergence System (NCS) 5500 Modular Platforms – the following models only:
NCS S5504
NCS S5508
NCS S5516


For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

Determine Whether IP Packet Filtering on the Egress Direction Is Enabled

To determine whether an egress IPv4 or IPv6 ACL is configured, use the show running-config | include ipv4 access-group .* egress or the show running-config | include ipv6 access-group .* egress CLI command. If the command returns output, the feature is configured, as shown in the following examples:


RP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS-5508-A#show running-config | include ipv4 access-group .* egress
Wed Mar  12 16:00:00.000 UTC
Building configuration...
 ipv4 access-group EgressACL egress
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS-5508-A#


RP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS-5508-A#show running-config | include ipv6 access-group .* egress
Wed Mar  12 16:00:00.000 UTC
Building configuration...
 ipv6 access-group EgressACL egress
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS-5508-A#

Note: All interface egress types are affected except a bridged virtual interface (BVI).</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

IOS Software
IOS XE Software
NX-OS Software</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass protections that are provided by an ACL that is applied on an affected device. The overall impact of exploitation is organization specific because it depends on the importance of the assets that the ACL was supposed to protect. Customers should evaluate how exploitation of this vulnerability would impact their network and proceed according to their own vulnerability-handling and remediation processes.

In affected products, for traffic that is received on an ingress interface and is destined for an egress interface on a different line card (where the ACL is applied), certain packets that are received on the ingress interface and directed out of the egress interface are not being subjected to the configured egress ACL.

Traffic that is received on an ingress interface and destined to an egress interface on the same line card is not impacted by this vulnerability. The egress ACL is handled appropriately when the ingress and egress interfaces are on the same line card.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
