  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to issue commands on the underlying operating system as the root user and allow IP access filters to be bypassed.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-multi-3VpsXOxO ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-multi-3VpsXOxO"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">CVE-2025-20283 and CVE-2025-20284: At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC, regardless of device configuration.

CVE-2025-20285: At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC if the IP Access Restriction feature was enabled.

Note: The IP Access Restriction feature allows administrators to control which IP address or range of IP addresses can access the Cisco ISE admin portal and services. For more details, see Configure IP Access Restriction in ISE ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/identity-services-engine/222103-configure-ip-access-restriction-in-ise.html"].

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.

Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:

CVE-2025-20283 and CVE-2025-20284: Cisco ISE API Authenticated Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

Multiple vulnerabilities in a specific API of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as root.

These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker with valid credentials could exploit these vulnerabilities by submitting a crafted API request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands as the root user. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid high-privileged credentials.

Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

Bug ID(s): CSCwp02806 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwp02806"] and CSCwp02819 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwp02819"]
CVE ID: CVE-2025-20283 and CVE-2025-20284
Security Impact Rating (SIR): Medium
CVSS Base Score: 6.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-20285: Cisco ISE IP Access Restriction for Admin Access Bypass Vulnerability

A vulnerability in the IP Access Restriction feature of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured IP access restrictions and log in to the device from a disallowed IP address.

This vulnerability is due to improper enforcement of access controls that are configured using the IP Access Restriction feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the API from an unauthorized source IP address. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the targeted device from an IP address that should have been restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Bug ID(s): CSCwp02811 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwp02811"]

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
