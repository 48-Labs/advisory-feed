    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco TelePresence Supervisor MSE 8050 contains a vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization and a reload of the affected system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.



This advisory is available at the following link:

https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130515-mse["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130515-mse"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco TelePresence Supervisor MSE 8050 running software versions 2.2(1.17) and earlier are affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco TelePresence MSE 8000 Series is a chassis-based platform for high-definition video conferencing and voice communication. The Cisco TelePresence Supervisor MSE 8050 is the core of the Cisco TelePresence MSE 8000 Series and provides management service for the chassis and other Cisco TelePresence products that are supported as part of the Cisco TelePresence MSE 8000 Series.



A vulnerability in  the network stack of the Cisco TelePresence MSE 8050
Supervisor could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high
CPU utilization and a reload of the affected system.



The vulnerability is
due to improper handling and processing of TCP connection requests sent at
a high rate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
a sequence of TCP segments at a high rate to the management IP address
of the affected system. A full TCP three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU utilization, which may trigger a reload of the affected system and cause a denial of service condition.



This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCuf76076["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf76076"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and CSCuf79763["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf79763"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1236</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">This vulnerability has been resolved in Cisco TelePresence Supervisor MSE 8050 software versions 2.3(1.31) and above.
