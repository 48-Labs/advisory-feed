  <cvrf:DocumentNotes>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the RESTCONF and NETCONF services of Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) on an affected system that is running as the root user. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be a member of the admin group.

This vulnerability exists because user-supplied input is not properly validated when either RESTCONF or NETCONF is used to upload packages to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted package file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write crafted files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem or delete arbitrary files from the filesystem of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.

Note: By default, during install, Cisco NSO will be set up to run as the root user unless the --run-as-user option is used.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
