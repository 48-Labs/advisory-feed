    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">The Cisco 10000 Series Router is affected by a denial of service  (DoS) vulnerability where an attacker could cause a device reload by  sending a series of ICMP packets.

  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

 Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are also available.
  This advisory is posted at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-c10k ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-c10k"].

Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories. Nine of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the September 2011 Bundled Publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:

    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco 10000 Series Routers that are running an affected version of Cisco IOS are affected.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running  on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue  the show version command to display the system banner.  The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software  by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System  Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in  parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release  name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is  running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image  name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in  the white paper Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide available at:    http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html ["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.

  Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability.

  No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">The Cisco 10000 Series Router is affected by a denial of service  (DoS) vulnerability where an unauthenticated attacker could cause a  device reload by sending a series of ICMP packets.

Traffic destined to the device or transit traffic could trigger the effects of this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtk62453 ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtk62453"]  (registered ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only)  and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-3270.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Traffic destined to the device or transit traffic could trigger the  effects of this vulnerability. Subsequently, the only workaround  available is to block ICMP packets destined to the affected device and  all ICMP transit traffic.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt ["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance.

Additionally, the Cisco IOS Software Checker is available on the Cisco Security (SIO) portal at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x"]. It provides several features for checking which Security Advisories affect specified versions of Cisco IOS Software.
  Cisco IOS Software
Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release For This Advisory column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2011 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release, where possible.
