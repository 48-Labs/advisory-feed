    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco IOS Software for Cisco Catalyst 6000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly.

This vulnerability is due to improper handling of process-switched traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-dos-Hq4d3tZG ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-dos-Hq4d3tZG"]

This advisory is part of the March 2024 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75056"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software and have port security; device classifier; or authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) enabled:

Catalyst 6500 Series Switches with Supervisor Engine 2T or 6T
Catalyst 6800 Series Switches with Supervisor Engine 2T or 6T

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.

Determine Whether Port Security Is Enabled

To determine whether a device is configured with port security, use the show running-config | include interface|port-security command. If port security is enabled on an interface, the device is affected by this vulnerability.

The following is an example of output from a device that has port security enabled:


Router#show running-config | include interface|port-security
interface GigabitEthernet1/2
switchport port-security

The following is an example of output from a device that does not have port security enabled:


Router#show running-config | include interface|port-security
interface GigabitEthernet1/1
interface GigabitEthernet1/2

Determine Whether Device Classifier Is Enabled

To determine whether a device is configured with device classifier, use the show running-config | include device classifier command. If the command returns output, the device is affected by this vulnerability.

The following is an example of output from a device that has device classifier enabled:


Router#show running-config | include device classifier
device classifier

Determine Whether AAA Is Enabled

To determine whether a device is configured with AAA, use the show running-config | include system-auth-control|interface|port-control|mab command. If AAA is enabled on an interface, the device is affected by this vulnerability.

The following is an example of output from a device that has AAA enabled:


Router#show running-config | include system-auth-control|interface|port-control|mab
dot1x system-auth-control
interface TenGigabitEthernet5/1
authentication order mab dot1x
authentication priority mab dot1x
authentication port-control auto
mab
interface TenGigabitEthernet5/2
interface TenGigabitEthernet5/3

The following is an example of output from a device that does not have AAA enabled:


Router#show running-config | include system-auth-control|interface|port-control|mab
interface GigabitEthernet1/1
interface GigabitEthernet1/2</cvrf:Note>

    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

The Cisco Support and Downloads page ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.

When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
  Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
        Cisco IOS Software
To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"]. This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).

To use the tool, go to the Cisco Software Checker ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x"] page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory. To use the form, follow these steps:

Choose which advisories the tool will search—only this advisory, only advisories with a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR) ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr"], or all advisories.
Enter a release number—for example, 15.9(3)M2 or 17.3.3.
Click Check.
