    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the hybrid access control list (ACL) processing of IPv4 packets in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL.

This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of packets when a specific configuration of the hybrid ACL exists. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured ACL on the affected device.

For more information, see the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ncs-hybridacl-crMZFfKQ ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ncs-hybridacl-crMZFfKQ"]

This advisory is part of the March 2025 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2025 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75548"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and had a hybrid IPv4 ACL configured with compress level 3 that matches specific characteristics:

IOS XR White box (IOSXRWBD)
Network Convergence Series (NCS) 540 Series Routers
NCS 560 Series Routers
NCS 5500 Series
NCS 5700 Series

For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

Determine Whether a Hybrid IPv4 ACL is Vulnerable

1. Determine whether the device has a hybrid ACL configured.

To determine whether a hybrid IPv4 ACL is configured, use the show running-config | include ipv4 access-group .* compress level 3 CLI command. If the command returns output, a hybrid IPv4 ACL is configured, as shown in the following example:


RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Router#show running-config | include ipv4 access-group .* compress level 3
Wed Mar  12 16:00:00.000 UTC
Building configuration...
 ipv4 access-group IngressACL ingress compress level 3
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Router#

If it is not configured, the device is not affected by this vulnerability.

If it is configured, proceed to Step 2.

2. Examine the ACLs.

To examine the contents of each hybrid ACL that was identified in the previous step, use the show access-list &lt;Name of ACL&gt; CLI command. If the number of different source network object groups is 32 or more or if the number of different destination network object groups is 32 or more, proceed to Step 3. If the number is less than 32, the ACL is not affected by this vulnerability.

The following example shows 33 access control entries (ACEs) with 33 unique source network object groups and 33 unique destination network object groups:

3. Examine the object groups.

If the command returns output with 32 or more different source network object groups or 32 or more different destination network object groups, then it is necessary to examine the contents of each group that appears in each ACE using the show object-group network ipv4 &lt;name of each network object-group&gt; CLI command from the previous step.

If the same IPv4 prefix, host, or range entry is found in 32 or more of the source network object groups or in 32 or more of the destination network object groups, then the ACL is affected by this vulnerability.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:

IOS Software
IOS XE Software
NX-OS Software</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="4">Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass protections that are provided by an ACL that is applied on an affected device. The overall impact of exploitation is organization specific because it depends on the importance of the assets that the ACL was supposed to protect. Customers should evaluate how exploitation of this vulnerability would impact their network and proceed according to their own vulnerability-handling and remediation processes.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.

Examine the object groups that make up the ACL. If the same IPv4 source or destination or both appear more than 31 times in object groups that comprise the ACL, remove access control entries until there are 31 or fewer entries of the same IPv4 address in both the source and destination entries.

While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">When considering software upgrades ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
