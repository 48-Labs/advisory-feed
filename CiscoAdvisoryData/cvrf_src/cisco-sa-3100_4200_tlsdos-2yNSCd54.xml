    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the TLS 1.3 implementation for a specific cipher for Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 3100 and 4200 Series devices could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to consume resources that are associated with incoming TLS 1.3 connections, which eventually could cause the device to stop accepting any new SSL/TLS or VPN requests.

This vulnerability is due to the implementation of the TLS 1.3 Cipher TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of TLS 1.3 connections with the specific TLS 1.3 Cipher TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition where no new incoming encrypted connections are accepted. The device must be reloaded to clear this condition.

Note: These incoming TLS 1.3 connections include both data traffic and user-management traffic. After the device is in the vulnerable state, no new encrypted connections can be accepted.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-3100_4200_tlsdos-2yNSCd54 ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-3100_4200_tlsdos-2yNSCd54"]

This advisory is part of the August 2025 release of the Cisco Secure Firewall ASA, Secure FMC, and Secure FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: August 2025 Semiannual Cisco Secure Firewall ASA, Secure FMC, and Secure FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75415"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Software and Cisco Secure FTD Software if they are running on a Cisco Secure Firewall 3100 or 4200 Series device that has an SSL listen socket and is configured to allow the TLS 1.3 Cipher TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256. This is not the default configuration.

For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software ["#fs"] section of this advisory.
  Determine Whether a Device Can Process TLS Packets
To determine whether a device that is running Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Software or Cisco Secure FTD Software can process TLS packets, use the show asp table socket | include SSL command and look for an SSL listening socket on any TCP port. The following example shows the output for a Cisco Secure Firewall ASA device with SSL listen sockets on TCP ports 443 and 8443:


ciscoasa# show asp table socket | include SSL
SSL       00185038  LISTEN     172.16.0.250:443    0.0.0.0:*
SSL       00188638  LISTEN      10.0.0.250:8443    0.0.0.0:*

   Identify Vulnerable TLS 1.3 Cipher Software Configuration
Devices are affected by this vulnerability only if the TLS 1.3 Cipher TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 is configured. To determine whether a device that is running Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Software or Cisco Secure FTD Software has TLS 1.3 Cipher TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 configured, use the show running-config all ssl | include TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 CLI command. If output is returned, as shown in the following example, the device is considered vulnerable:


ciscoasa# show running-config all ssl | include TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
ssl cipher tlsv1.3 custom "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256"</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Only products listed in the Vulnerable Products ["#vp"] section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Indicators of Compromise" Type="General" Ordinal="4">This vulnerability causes devices to run out of Security Context Block (SCB) handles, which are used to process all incoming encrypted connections, including SSL, VPN, TLS, and Internet Key Exchange (IKE). Look for the following two indicators of compromise that could be present if this vulnerability is being exploited:

Logged SSL Errors

The show ssl errors CLI command could show the following repeating errors:


error:1424A044:SSL routines:write_state_machine:internal error@libssl_ext_hndshk_accel.c:87
error:1424A044:SSL routines:write_state_machine:internal error@libssl_ext_hndshk_accel.c:87

SSL Error Counters

The show counters | include HANDLE_ALLOC_FAILED counter would be incrementing rapidly, as shown in the following example:


ciscoasa# show counters | include HANDLE_ALLOC_FAILED
CRYPTO       HANDLE_ALLOC_FAILED                           56169   Summary

Note: When a device is in this failed state, a reboot is required to restore connectivity.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. Use the no ssl cipher tlsv1.3 custom &lt;cipher list&gt; CLI command to remove the cipher.

While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.
