    <cvrf:Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">On September 7, 2017, the Apache Software Foundation released a security bulletin that disclosed a vulnerability in the Freemarker tag functionality of the Apache Struts 2 package. The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The Apache Software Foundation classifies the vulnerability as a Medium Severity vulnerability. For more information about this vulnerability, refer to the Details ["#details"] section of this advisory.

Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of the Apache Struts 2 package that is affected by this vulnerability.

The following Snort rules can be used to detect possible exploitation of this vulnerability: Snort SIDs 44327 through 44330.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170909-struts2-rce ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170909-struts2-rce"]</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">For information about whether a product is affected by this vulnerability, refer to the Vulnerable Products ["#vulnerable"] and Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable ["#notVulnerable"] sections of this advisory. The Vulnerable Products section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"] and contain additional platform-specific information, including any available workarounds and fixed software releases.

Note: Only Cisco products that include Struts are listed in the "Vulnerable Products" or "Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" sections.  If a Cisco product is not listed, then it does not include Struts and is therefore not affected.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">Cisco documents detailed information about fixed software releases in the Cisco bugs listed in this table. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"]. When planning a software upgrade, customers should review the bugs directly because the bugs will have the most current and up-to-date information.

    <cvrf:Note Title="Details" Type="General" Ordinal="5">A vulnerability in Apache Struts 2 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system.

The vulnerability is due to the unsafe use of writable expression values in Freemarker content that is processed by the affected application. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by adding malicious values to writable expressions that the attacker submits to the affected application for processing. If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the affected application on the targeted system.

This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-12611

The Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this vulnerability is Critical.</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Any workarounds that address this vulnerability will be documented in the Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"].</cvrf:Note>
    <cvrf:Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="7">Updates for affected software releases will be published when they are available and information about those updates will be documented in Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID"].

When Cisco releases software updates that address this vulnerability, customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts ["https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
https://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["https://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Fixed Releases

To determine the affected and fixed releases for each vulnerable product, refer to the Cisco bug identified for the product in the Vulnerable Products ["#vulnerable"] section of this advisory. Cisco bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool ["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/"].</cvrf:Note>
